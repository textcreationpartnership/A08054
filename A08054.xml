            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehould now the fourth yeare is paſſed, when as preparing my ſelfe to my End, I retire to a place of quietnes and reſt, exempt from negotiations, and throng of Buſines; but not exempt from the meditation of the ſacred Scriptures, and from the writing of ſuch things, which to me in tyme of meditation do occur; That if I be not able to profit others either by my owne ſpeaches, or by compoſing of any large and voluminous Booke; at leaſt that I may be of power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance my Brethren in their ſpirituall Good, by ſome ſmall deuout Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Now calling to mind, of what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect I might chiefly make choyce, which might diſpoſe me towards dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, &amp; might profit my Brethren towards liuing well; <hi>The death of our Lord</hi> preſented it ſelfe to me, and that laſt <hi>Sermon</hi> of his, which conſiſting of <hi>ſeauen moſt ſhort</hi> (but moſt graue) <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> the <hi>Redeemer of the World</hi> from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14178:4"/> the Croſſe, as from a high and eminent Chayre, deliuered to all Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind: Since in that Sermon, or in thoſe <hi>ſeauen Words,</hi> all thoſe Points are contained, of which the ſaid Lord thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. <hi>Behould, we go vp to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and all things shalbe conſummate, which were written by the Prophets, of the ſonne of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe things, which the Prophets did foretell of Chriſt, are reduced to foure Heads, or branches. To wit, to his <hi>Preaching</hi> and Sermons made to the People; To his <hi>Prayer</hi> directed to his Father; To the moſt <hi>grieuous Euills</hi> which he was to ſuffer; To ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime and <hi>admirable Works</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him. All which ſeuerall Points did admirably ſhine in the life of Chriſt. For firſt, our Lord did moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preach in the Temple, in the Synagogues, in the fields, in deſert &amp; ſolitary places, in priuate Houſes, and to conclude euen out of the ſhip, to the People ſtanding vpon the ſhore.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, He ſpent for the moſt part, whole nights in Prayer to God; for thus the Euangeliſt ſpeaketh: <hi>Luc.</hi> 6. <hi>He paſſed the whole night in Prayer to God,</hi> Now his admirable and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14178:4"/> aſtoniſhing working of <hi>Wonders,</hi> of which the holy Goſpells are very full, doth concerne the expelling of the Deuils, curing the ſicke, multiplying of bread, and in appeaſing or allaying tempeſts or ſtormes all ſea. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the <hi>Euills</hi> that, in recompence of the Good which he had done, were perpetrated againſt him, were many, not only in contumely of Words, but alſo in ſtoning of him, and in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoring to caſt him headlong dovvne from a fearefull Precipice.</p>
            <p>But all theſe ſeuerall Points were conſummated and perfected moſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the Croſſe. For firſt, He ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly &amp; perſuadingly preached from the Croſſe, as that many returned from thence, <hi>knocking their Breaſts.</hi> And further, not only the harts of men (but euen the ſtones, as it were, through a ſecret compaſsion) were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and torne a ſunder. He in like manner ſo prayed vpon the Croſſe, as that the Apoſtle ſayth thereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>Cum clamore valido, &amp; lachrimis, exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus est pro ſua reuerentia,</hi> With a ſtrong Crye, and teares, he was heard for his reuerence. Now what he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the Croſſe, was of ſo high a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14178:5"/> nature, in reference to thoſe things which he had ſuffered through the reſt of the life; as that they alone may be thought peculiarly to belong to the <hi>Paſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, He neuer wrought greater Prodigies and ſignes, then when lying vpon the Croſſe, he was brought to extreme imbecillity and weaknes. For at that time, he did not only exhibite Miracles from Heauen, (the which the Iewes had before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely demaunded of him) but alſo a litle after, he wrought the greateſt Miracle of all; When being dead and buried, by his owne proper force and Vertue, he returned from Hell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his Body, reſtored it againe to life; yea to an immortall life. Therfore we may conclude, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe all things were truly performed and accompliſhed, which were written by the Prophets of the Sonne of Man.</p>
            <p>But before we deſcend to write of the particular <hi>Words</hi> of our Lord, I hold it conducing to our purpoſe, to ſpeake ſome thing of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> it ſelf, which was the Chayre or Pulpit of the Preacher, the Altar of the Prieſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fizing; the race, or place of him that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14178:5"/> did combat and feight, the ſhop (as it were) of working miraculous things. Firſt then, touching the forme of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> the more common Opinion of the Ancients is, that it conſiſted of three ſeuerall parcels of Wood; One long, vpon the which the Body of our Lord crucified, was laid or extended; another ouerthwart, in which the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds were faſtened; the third was affixed and ioined to the lower part, vpon the which the feet did reſt, but ſo nailed thereto, that they could not be moued from thence. This is the Opinion of the two moſt ancient Fathers, <hi>S. Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Irenaeus:</hi> Who clearely ſhew, that both his feete did reſt vpon the Wood, &amp; that the one foote was not lying vpon the other. From which poſture of our Lords Body it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there were foure nayles of Chriſt, and not only three, as many do imagine, who out of that conceit do paint Chriſt our Lord, ſo vpon the Croſſe, as if he had the one foot vpon the other. But <hi>Gregorius Turonenſis (l. de glo. mart. c.</hi> 6.) moſt euidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth this, and fortifieth his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from ancient Pictures of Chriſt crucified. And I my ſelfe did ſee at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14178:6"/> 
               <hi>Paris</hi> in the Kings Library, certaine moſt ancient <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells, in diuers places wherof Chriſt was painted Crucified, but euer with foure Nayles.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the long <hi>Wood</hi> did ſomwhat appeare aboue that parcell of Wood, which was ouerthwart, as <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory Nyſſenus</hi> do write; And this ſeemeth alſo to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who writing to the <hi>Epheſians, c.</hi> 3. thus ſayth: <hi>That you may be able to comprehend with all the Saintes, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth,</hi> (to wit of the Croſſe of Chriſt.) By which wordes he clearly deſcribeth the figure of the Croſſe, which hath foure extremities; to wit, <hi>Latitude</hi> in the ouerthwart or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuerſe Wood; <hi>Longitude</hi> in the long Wood; <hi>Altitude,</hi> in that part of the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Wood which appeared aboue the ouerth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart; and <hi>Profundity</hi> in that part of the long Wood, which was ſtucke into the ground.</p>
            <p>Our Lord did not vndergoe this kind of Torment by chance, or vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; but made ſpeciall choice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of it euen from all Eternity, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14178:6"/> 
               <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>Why our Lord did chooſe this kind of puniſhment, he only knoweth, who choſe it: Notwithſtanding there are not wanting ſome Miſteries ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the which the holy Fathers haue left to vs in Writing. <hi>Saint Irenaeus</hi> writeth, that the two armes of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> do agree vnder one Title, in the which was written, <hi>Ieſus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum,</hi> that we might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thereby, the two People (to wit the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Gentils</hi>) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14178:7"/> vvere deuided, in the end were to be ioyned togeather into one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, vnder one Head which is Chriſt. <hi>S. Gregory Nyſſene</hi> writeth, that part of the Croſſe, vvhich looketh towards Heauen, to ſignify, that by the Croſſe, as by a key, Heauen is opened to man; and that part of it, which declineth towards the Center of the World, to denote that Hel was ſpoiled by Chriſt, when he deſcended thither. The two armes of the Croſſe, which are ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards the Eaſt, and Weſt, to ſhaddow, that the repurging of the whole World was after to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Bloud of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But <hi>S. Ierome, S. Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> do teach, that the chiefe Miſtery of the Croſſe is briefly touched in thoſe vvords of the Apoſtle: <hi>Quae ſit latitudo, longitudo, ſublimitas, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundum;</hi> Since (ſay theſe Fathers) that firſt the Attributs of God are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in theſe Word, to wit, Power in height; In depth wiſdome; in Latitude goodnes; in Longitude Eternity. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Vertues of Chriſt ſuffering, are adumbrated and <hi>Typically</hi> figured therein; As in Latitude <hi>Charity;</hi> in Longitude Patience; in Altitude Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14178:7"/> in Profundity Humility. Laſtly the Vertues, vvhich are neceſſary to thoſe, who are ſaued by Chriſt, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo here ſignified: In depth Faith; in height Hope; in breadth <hi>Charity;</hi> in length Perſeuerance. From the which we are to be inſtructed, that <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (vvhich deſeruedly is called the Queene of Vertue) euery where hath place in God, in Chriſt, and in vs. But touching other Vertues, ſome of them are in God, others in Chriſt, and others in vs. And therefore it is leſſe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, if in thoſe laſt Words of Chriſt, which vve now vndertake to explaine, <hi>Charity</hi> do obtaine the firſt Place.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore we will explicate the three firſt <hi>Words or Sentences,</hi> which were ſpoken by Chriſt about the ſixt houre, before the Sunne was obſcured, and darknes couered the whole Earth. Next we will diſcourſe of the then defect of the Sunne. That done, we vvill explaine &amp; vnfould the reſt of the Words of our Lord, which were ſpoken about the ninth houre, as <hi>S.

               <p>Novv, ſo far forth, as concernes the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14178:9"/> three firſt Sentences, vvhich belong to others; the firſt is directed to our Lords Enemies, the ſecond to his friends, the laſt to thoſe of his kinred and affinity. The reaſon of this Order or Method is this: <hi>Charity</hi> firſt relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and helpeth ſuch as be in want; And thoſe, who at that tyme ſuffered moſt ſpirituall wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, were his Enemies; and we alſo as being the diſciples of ſo great a Maiſter vvere in want, as ſtanding in neede of being inſtructed hovv to loue out Enemies. Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is far more difficult, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to know how to loue our friends or allies; ſince this is moſt eaſy, being (after a ſort) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with vs, and increaſeth with vs, and doth often preuaile more then reaſon requireth. Therefore the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſaith: <hi>Ieſus autem dicebat,</hi> where the word <hi>(autem)</hi> deſigneth the time and occaſion of praying for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and implyeth an <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> or oppoſition of words with words, and vvorkes with workes. As if the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt would haue ſaid: <hi>They did cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify our Lord, and deuided</hi> his garments in his ovvne ſight; and others derided, traduced, and defamed him, as a ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and Lyar. But he ſeing and hearing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14178:9"/> theſe paſſages, and ſuffering moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement paines, by reaſon of his hands &amp; feete moſt cruelly pierced through vvith nailes, did render good for euill, and ſaid: <hi>Pater dimitte cis,</hi> Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them.</p>
               <p>He heere calleth him <hi>Father,</hi> not <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>Lord;</hi> as vvell knowing, there vvas need of the benignity of a Father in this buſines, but not of the ſeuerity of a Iudge. And becauſe to appeaſe God (doubtleſly offended through ſuch perpetrated impieties) it was conuenient to interpoſe the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Name of a <hi>Father;</hi> Therefore that vvord, <hi>Father,</hi> ſeemeth thus much in this place to ſignify: I am thy Sonne, vvho now ſuffer; I pardon them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them alſo O Father.

And truly they ſeeme to be the firſt, who actually nayled Chriſt vnto the Croſſe, and who deuided his garments among themſelues, and then all thoſe are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, who were the Cauſe of our Lords Paſsion; for example <hi>Pilat,</hi> who pronounced ſentence againſt Chriſt, The <hi>People</hi> who cryed, <hi>tolle, tolle, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifige eum,</hi> away, away with him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him; The chiefe of the Prieſts and the Scribes, who falſly accuſed him; And to aſcend higher, euen the <hi>First Man</hi> himſelfe, and all his Poſterity, who through ſinne, gaue occaſion of Chriſt his Paſsion. Therefore our Lord prayed for pardon, from the Croſſe, for all his Enemies.

Our Bleſſed Lord did ſee, that thou once waſt in the number of his Enemies, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he prayed to his Father for thee (neither ſeeking after him, nor deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him ſo to pray) that this thy mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhould not be imputed to thee. Is it not then thy duty, euer to haue euer imprinted in thy hart, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſo benigne and louing a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, and not to let ſlip any occaſion of ſeruing of him? And is it not in like ſort reaſonable, that thou, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by ſo great an example, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not only learne to pardon thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and to pray for them, but alſo that thou ſhouldeſt perſwade all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the ſame? Say therefore, O <hi>my Soule,</hi> this is moſt iuſt and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and I do much couet and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to accompliſh the ſame, and the rather, ſeing he, who hath left this moſt remarkable Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, is ready out of his goodnes to affoard his effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hand and help, to the effecting of ſo great a VVorke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non enim ſciunt, quid faciunt,</hi> For they know not what they do. That
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14178:13"/> this Interceſsion of Chriſt may ſeeme more reaſonable, he doth extenuate &amp; excuſe the Offence of his Enemies, in ſuch ſort as he can. Certainly he could not excuſe the Iniuſtice of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> neither the Cruelty of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, nor the malice of the Chiefe of the Prieſts, nor the fooliſhnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes of the Common People; nor finally the falſe teſtimonies of thoſe, who ſwore againſt him. Only this remained, that he did excuſe the Ignorance of them all; For truly (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.) <hi>If they had knowne, they neuer would haue crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> But although neither <hi>Pilate,</hi> nor the Chiefe Prieſts, nor the People, nor the Miniſters of his Paſsion, did know <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the Lord of Glory; yet did <hi>Pilate</hi> know, that Chriſt was a iuſt and holy man, and deliuered ouer to him through the malice of the Chiefe Prieſts; As alſo thoſe high Prieſts did know, that he was the true Chriſt which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Law, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth; becauſe they could not deny, neither did they deny, but that he did worke many miracles, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foretould the true <hi>Meſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14178:13"/>
               <p>To conclude, the People did know, that Chriſt was condemned without iuſt cauſe, ſince <hi>Pilate</hi> openly cried out, ſaying: <hi>I find no cauſe in this Man; I am innocent of the Bloud of this iuſt man.</hi> And although the Iewes, or the Chiefe of them, or the People did not know, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Lord of Glory; Yet they might well haue knowne the ſame, had not Malice blinded their Harts; For thus S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>VVhereas he had donne ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles before them, they belieued not in him, becauſe Eſay the Prophet ſaid: He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their Heart, that they may not ſee with their eyes, nor vnderſtand with their Heart, and be conuerted &amp;c.</hi> But yet this blinding doth not excuſe the man blinded, ſince it is Voluntary, though not precedent; euen as thoſe, who do ſinne of malice, do labour indeed with ſome Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which Ignorance doth not excuſe them, in that it doth not precede, or goe before but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the ſinne. For the <hi>VViſeman</hi> truly ſayth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24. <hi>They do erre, who worke Euill;</hi> And the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth therto, teaching, that, <hi>Omnis malus, ignorans.</hi> And vpon this ground
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14178:14"/> it may be truly ſaid of all ſinners: <hi>Non ſciunt, quid faciunt.</hi> For it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſire or will <hi>Euill,</hi> with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Euill;</hi> ſince the Obiect of the will, is not a thing either good or Euil, but only that which is good; VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe, who chooſe what is euill, do euer chooſe it, as it is repreſented vnder the ſhew of Good; yea vnder the colour of the chiefeſt good, that then can be obtained.</p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the inferiour part of the ſoule, which doth darken reaſon, and cauſeth it to diſcerne that ſeming Good only, which is in the thing, that is deſired. For who chooſeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery or Theft, vvould neuer chuſe the ſame, except his mind were bent vpon the Good of the delight or gaine, which is in Adultery or Theft; as alſo except he had ſhut his eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the euill of Turpitude or Iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, vvhich is in Adulterie or Theft. Therefore euery ſinner is like vnto a man, who deſiring to caſt himſelfe dovvne from a great height into a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, doth firſt ſhut his eyes, and then after caſt himſelfe into the Riuer.

                  </gap>y Ignorance, vvhich Ignorance doth not excuſe, in that it is Voluntary. But heere it may be demanded, if this Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance doth not excuſe, why then doth our Lord ſay; <hi>Forgiue them, for they know not what they do?</hi> To this it may be anſwered, that the words of our Lord may be vnderſtood chiefly &amp; firſt of them, who crucified him; whome it is probable to haue beene then ignorant not only of the <hi>Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Chriſt, but alſo of his Innocency, and that they ſimply performed the worke or charge impoſed vpon them. Therefore for theſe Men our Lord did moſt truly ſay: <hi>Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, if the Words be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of vs, before we had a <hi>Being,</hi> or of many ſinners abſent, which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were ignorant of what was then done at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> our Lord with iuſt reaſon ſaid: <hi>They know not what they doe.</hi> To conclude, if the words be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of thoſe, who were preſent, and were not ignorant, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> or an innocent Man; then it is to be ſaid, that the Charity of Chriſt was ſo great, as that he was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14178:15"/> willing to leſſen the ſinne of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in ſuch manner as he could. For although that Ignorance doth not ſimply and abſolutely excuſe, yet it ſeemeth to prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſome reaſon (though weake) of excuſe; becauſe they had more grieuouſly ſinned, if they had wholy wanted all Ignorance. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord was not ignorant, that that excuſe was not a reall excuſe, but only a ſhaddow of an excuſe, yet it pleaſed him to alledge it for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; that from thence we might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of the good Will and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our Lord towards ſinners; &amp; how deſirous he would haue beene to haue taken and alledged a better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe euen for <hi>Caiphas</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> if a better and more warrantable could haue been found, or pretended.</p>

For this is the force and Vertue of true Charity; to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14178:17"/> wit to haue peace with all men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not any for Enemies, but to liue peaceably with thoſe who hate peace.</p>
               <p>And this is that, which in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> is verified of the Vertue of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Charity. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>Many waters cannot quench Charity, nor flouds ſhall ouerwhelme it.</hi> Theſe many VVaters are many Paſsions, which the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals of wickednes, as ſo many helliſh ſtormes by the Iewes and Gentills (as by cloudes full of hate) haue ſhowred downe vpon Chriſt; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, this deluge of VVaters (that is, of paines and vexations) could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the fier of Charity, which did burne in the breaſt of Chriſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Charity of Chriſt did (as it were) ſwim aboue that inundation of many waters, &amp; burning ſaid: <hi>Father, forgiue them.</hi> Neither only were thoſe many VVaters not able to extinguiſh the Charity of Chriſt, but alſo the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing flouds of Perſecution could not ouerwhelme &amp; drowne the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the members of Chriſt. And therefore a litle after, Chriſtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty euen boyling in the breaſt of <hi>S.

And after this the perfect and inuincible Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, being dilated and ſpread in the Harts of many thouſands of Martyrs and Confeſſours, did ſo fight and ſtriue againſt the flouds both of inuiſible and viſible Perſecutours, as that it may be truly pronounced: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the end of the world ſhall the flouds of Perſecution put out, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the fyer of Charity.</p>
               <p>And that we may aſcend from the Humanity of Chriſt to his Diuinity: Great was the Charity of Chriſt, as being man, towards his Crucifiers; But the Charity of Chriſt, as God, and of the Father, and of the Holy Ghoſt towards men, was, and euen to the conſummation of the world, ſhalbe far greater; I meane, towards ſuch men, who with God himſelfe did wage emnity and malice, and who (if it had layn in their power) would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded and thruſt him out of Heauen, and haue killed him. Who therefore but in thought can conceaue the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, towards vngratefull and wicked men? God ſpared not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſinning, neither gaue he them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14178:18"/> place of Repentance: Yet he patiently tolerateth men, who are ſinners, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, reuolting to the Deuill the Enemy of God. And which is more, he doth not only tolerate them, but in the meane tyme doth maintaine and nouriſh them; yea ſuſtayneth and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth them. For as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>in him we liue, and moue, and be. Act.</hi> 17. Neither doth our mercifull Lord only nouriſh, feed, and ſuſtayne his Enemies; but withall euen heapeth benefits vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, graceth them with wit, furniſh them with riches, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them to honours, placeth them in the Throne of Regall Soueraignty; euer expecting in the meane time their returne from the Way of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perdition.</p>
               <p>But to forbeare to wander in that large field of diſcourſe, which manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the Charity of God towardes wicked men; and Enemies of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty; we will heare conſider only the benefit and fauour of Chriſt.

For to that end God did ſend his So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne into the world, who is <hi>Princeps pacis,</hi> that by him the world might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God. And therefore at the byrth of Chriſt, the Angels did ſing: <hi>Glory in the higheſt to God, &amp; in earth Peace to men.</hi> Therefore God loued the world (his Enemy) that through Chriſt he might procure reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and atonement with it, and that it being reconciled, might auoyde the puniſhment due to his Enemy.</p>
               <p>The world did not admit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue Chriſt, It did augment its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; It became rebellious againſt the Mediatour; God inſpired into the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, that he ſhould render good for euill, and that he ſhould pray for his Perſecutours, He prayed, and, <hi>was heard for his reuerence.

               <p>AN other fruite (and that very healhfull to all taſting the ſame) is, if men will learne to pardon eaſily Iniuries offered vnto them, and by this meanes to make friends of Enemies. Now for the perſuading hereto, the Example of Chriſt and God ought to be a moſt forcible argument and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14178:19"/> for if Chriſt did pardon his Crucifiers, and prayed for them, why ſhould not a Chriſtian man do the like? Yf God (the Creatour of all) in whoſe power it is, as being Lord &amp; Iudge, to take preſent reuenge vpon ſinners, doth neuertheleſſe expect, that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould returne to Pennance, and doth inuite him to peace and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and ſtands prepared to pardon all thoſe, who haue offended his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty; Why ſhould not a Creature be ready and willing to performe the ſame?

It is written in the hiſtory of the life and death of Saint <hi>Engelbertus,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cullen,</hi> that when he was entrapped by his Enemies in his iourney, and ſlayne by them, and he then ſaying in his Hart, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis, O Father pardon them;</hi> It was reuealed of him, that for this one act (being in a high manner gratefull to God) his ſoule was not only inſtantly taken vp by the Angels to Heauen; but that being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Quyre of Martyrs, obtained the Crowne of Martyrs, and after his death was illuſtrious for many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

               <p>O! if Chriſtians did know, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily (if themſelues would) they might be enriched with ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and might be aduanced to high Titles of Honour and glory, if ſo they would ſuppreſſe and curbe the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations and paſsions of their mind &amp; with a true fortitude would ſpurne at ſmall Iniuries againſt them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they would not be of ſuch a flinty and inexorable diſpoſition, to remit, or ſuffer wrongs and offences. But they will reply; It ſemeth to be aduerſe &amp; euen inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patible with the law &amp; right of Nature, that a man ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be betrampled and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpon by other men, offered wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs and diſgraces, either in word or deed: For we ſee euen brute Beaſts, who are carryed only by the inſtinct of Nature, to aſſault other Beaſts their Enemyes, with great fierſnes, and do labour to kill them. In like ſort, we haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in our ſelfes, that if vnexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we meete or fall vpon our Enemy; inſtantly our Choler is inflamed, our Bloud begins to riſe and boyle, and that we haue a deſire euen naturally of Reuenge.</p>

               <p>But he is greatly deceaued, who thus diſputeth, and he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly confound a iuſt defence, with an iniuſt reuenge. A iuſt defence is not ſubiect to reprehenſion; and this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

No man is forbidden to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, that a wrong be not offered him; But to reuenge an Iniury already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the diuine Law prohibiteth: ſince this belongeth not to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Man, but to the publike Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. And becauſe God is the King of kings, therefore he crieth out, &amp; ſayth: <hi>Reuenge to me, and I will reward. Deut.</hi> 32. Now that Beaſts with a maine fiercenes ruſh vpon other Beaſts their Enemies, this procedeth, in that Beaſts cannot diſcerne betwene Nature, and the Vice, or imperfection of Nature; but men, who are endued with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ought to make a diſtinction bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene Nature or the Perſon which is created good by God, and the Vice or ſinne which is euill, and proceedeth not from God. Therefore a man recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an Iniury, ought to loue the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14178:21"/> but to hate the Iniury; and not ſo much to be offended with his Enemy, as to communicate and pity him; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating herein Phyſitians, who loue their ſicke Patients, and therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to cure them; But do hate their diſeaſe and ſicknes, laboring with all their skill and art to expell it.</p>
               <p>And this is that which our Maiſter and Phyſitian of our Soules, <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> did teach, when he ſaid: <hi>Loue your Enemies, do good to them, that hate you, and pray for them that perſecute and abuſe you.

For he loued his Enemies, and he prayed for them, ſaying: Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, <hi>for they know not what they doe.</hi> Now whereas the Bloud begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to riſe and boyle in men, when they ſee them of whom they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued an iniurie; the reaſon of this, is, becauſe ſuch men are <hi>Homines ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males,</hi> and haue not yet learned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine with the bridle of Reaſon the

But ſuch men, as are <hi>Spirituales,</hi> to wit, ſpirituall, and know how not to yeald to their owne Paſsions, but to maiſter and ouerule them, are not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at their Enemies; but pitying the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Laurentio.</hi> O <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutour, thou haſt byn cruell againſt the Martyr, thou haſt beene cruell, I ſay; but thou hast increaſed his Palme, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou increaſest his paines; for what hath not thy wit inuented for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter glory of the Victour, when both the Triumphs, and the very Instruments of his Puniſhments do proclaime his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi> The which ſentence may be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed of all Martyrs, as alſo of the ancient Saints. For nothing hath made <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the Patriarch, more celebrious &amp; famous, then his Perſecution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from his owne Brethren; for whiles through enuy they ſould him
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14178:24"/> to the <hi>Madianits,</hi> they were thereby become the Cauſe, that he was made Prince of all <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp; of his Brethren.</p>
               <p>But paſſing ouer theſe points with a gentill touch; Let vs briefly gather togeather the many and great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which men ſuffer, who, that in the eye of man they may decline but the ſhadovv of diſgrace, do endeauour with all ſtifneſſe, and reſolution of mind, to reuenge the Iniuries recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from their Enemies. Firſt, they diſcouer and betray their owne folly, whiles they ſeeke to cure a leſſer Euill by a greater. For it is a Principle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, and taught by the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>That Euill is not to be done, that Good from thence may riſe;</hi> Euen as greater Euills are not to be perpetrated, for the preuention of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. Who receaueth an iniury, falleth into <hi>Malum Poenae:</hi> Who reuengeth an Iniury, falleth into <hi>malum Culpae:</hi> But <hi>malum Culpa</hi> is incomparably for greater, then <hi>malum Poenae,</hi> ſeing this later maketh a man miſerable but not wicked; the other maketh one both miſerable and wicked; This <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum poena</hi> depriueth a man of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Good, but <hi>malum Culpa,</hi> depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14178:24"/> him both of temporall and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Good. Therefore that man who to be freed of the Euill of Puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, falleth into the Euill of Offence, may well reſemble him, who to make his ſhoo (being ouer ſhort) fitting to his foote, is content to cut of part of his foote, which is euident madneſſe.</p>
               <p>But there is not any man to be found ſo groſly exceeding the limits euen of naturall Reaſon in temporall matters; Neuertheleſſe many are to be found ſo blinded, &amp; ſeeled vp in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that they feare not moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly to offend God, that thereby they may auoyd the ſhaddow (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue I ſaid) of diſgrace among men, or that they may conſerue the ſmoake of Honour with them. Theſe men do fall into the indignation and hate of God, and if they do not recall and make a ſerious introuerſion of their owne ſtate in tyme, and performe great Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they ſhalbe puniſhed with ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternall ſhame and diſgrace, &amp; ſhall loſe all eternall Honour and renowne. Furthermore ſuch men by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengefull proceedings, do a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull office to the Deuill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; vvho incite and ſtirre vp their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14178:25"/> Enemies to offer to them Wrongs &amp; Iniuries, to the end that Emnity, and want of Charity may riſe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them. Now how foule and vnworthy a thing is it to ſeeke rather to gratify the moſt cruell Enemy of mankind, then Chriſt Ieſus, I leaue to the iudgment &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all pious men.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: it often falleth out, that he who hath receaued an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, and ſeeketh reuenge, doth dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wound or kill his Enemy, and then by the ſentence of the Prince, all his goods being confiſcated, he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer death, or forced to fly his Country, to the vtter ruine &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of himſelfe, his Children, and his whole Houſe, and Family. Thus doth the Deuill play with, and delude ſuch men, who couet more to be Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls and ſlaues to falſe Honour, then to become ſeruants and brethren to Chriſt, our ſupreme King, and Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes with him in his moſt ample and euerlaſting Kingdome. Wherefore ſince ſo great and heauy a loſſe doth expect, and waite for thoſe fooliſh men, who contrary to the Precept of our Lord, refuſe to be reconciled to their Enemies; let all others, who haue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14178:25"/> true Iudgment, heare &amp; follow Chriſt (the Maiſter of vs all) teaching in his Goſpell, and confirming this his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in workes, euen from the Croſſe.</p>

               <p>The vvhich point our Lord did explaine in one of his Parables, vvhen he ſaid: <hi>Luc.</hi> 19. <hi>A certaine Noble man went into a farre Country, to take vnto himſelfe a kingdome, and to returne.</hi> This our Lord ſaid, being moſt neare vnto his Paſſion; ſignifying that by death, himſelfe was to goe into a far diſtant Country or Region, that is, to an other life, or vnto Heauen, which is moſt remote from the Earth; and to goe, to the end to receave a moſt lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge and euerlaſting kingdome; and after to returne at the day of iudgment, that he might make retribution ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of reward or puniſhment to all men, according as they had deſerued in this lyfe. Therefore of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, which preſently after his death he was to receaue, the wyſe <hi>Theefe</hi> ſaid: <hi>Remember me, when thou ſhalt come into thy kingdome.</hi> But was not Chriſt a king before his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Certainly he was; and therefore the <hi>Magi</hi> cryed out; <hi>Vbi est, qui natus eſt,

Neuertheleſſe he was a king in this world, as a ſtranger among his Enemies, and therefore he was acknowledged as a king only of few, but contemned and badly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many.

               <p>This Kingdome, ſo farre forth as it concerned the Beatitude of the Soule, Chriſt receaued euen from the beginning of his Conception; but as it concerned his Body, he had it not

For thus our Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: <hi>Ought not Christ to haue ſuffered theſe things, and ſo to enter into his glory?</hi> Which glory is called his glory, becauſe he is of power to communicate it to others, and in this reſpect he is ſaid to be, <hi>Rex gloriae, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus gloriae,</hi> and, <hi>Rex Regum:</hi> And he himſelfe ſaith to his diſciples. <hi>I diſpoſe for you a Kingdome.</hi> It is in our power to receaue glory, or a Kingdom, but not to giue; and accordingly it is ſaid to vs: <hi>Matth.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And indeed there were three emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reaſons, which might cauſe the Thiefe to wauer and reſt doubtfull of the Promiſe of Chriſt, except he had auerred it with ſo earneſt an aſſeuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The ſecond Reaſon is taken from <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſing, who at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſeemed to be reduced &amp; brought to extremity of want, weaknes, &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. For the <hi>Thiefe</hi> might probably thus reaſon and diſcourſe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: Yf this man during his life tyme, was not able to performe any thing in behalfe of his friends, ſhall not he be leſſe able, being dead? The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may haue reference to the thing <hi>promiſed.</hi> For here <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but <hi>Paradiſe</hi> (as then all men
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14178:31"/> tooke notice) did belong not to the Soule, but to the Body; ſince by the Word, <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> a terreſtriall Paradiſe was vnderſtood by the Iewes. It had beene more credible to the <hi>Thiefe,</hi> and ſubiect to his beliefe, if our Lord had anſwered: <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me in the place of repoſe and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob.</hi> For theſe Reaſons therefore did our Lord premiſe thoſe words: <hi>Amen, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co tibi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hodie, to day.</hi> Our Lord ſayth not, In the day of Iudgment, when I ſhall place thee with the luſt vpon my right hand: Neither ſayth he, After ſome yeares of thy being in Purgatory, will I bring thee to a place of reſt; Nor doth he ſay: I will comfort thee after certaine Months, or Dayes; but he ſayth, <hi>This very day,</hi> before the ſunne ſhall ſet, thou ſhalt paſſe with me from the gibbet of the Croſſe, to the delights of Paradiſe. A wonderfull Liberality or Bounty of Chriſt, and a wonderfull happines of the ſinner. With iuſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therefore <hi>S. Austin</hi> (following S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> herein) is of Opinion, that this good <hi>Thiefe</hi> might be reputed a Martyr, and therefore eſcaping Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14178:32"/> did paſſe from this World im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to Heauen. The Reaſon, why the good <hi>Thiefe</hi> might be called a Martyr, is, in that he publikly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt, at ſuch tyme, when his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were afraid to ſpeake a word in Honour of him; therefore in regard of this his free and ready Confeſsion, his death with Chriſt, was reputed with God, as if he had ſuffered for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe words: <hi>Mecum eris, Thou ſhalt be with me;</hi> though no other thing ſhould be promiſed, then what theſe words only import, yet had it bene a great benefit and reward vnto the Thiefe: For as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> writeth: <hi>tract.</hi> 5. <hi>in Ioan.

VVhere could the good thiefe be euill being with Chriſt; and where could he be well being without Chriſt?</hi> For no ſmall reward and remuneration hath Chriſt promiſed to thoſe that follow him, when he ſaid, <hi>Ioan.</hi> 12. <hi>Yf any man miniſter to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there alſo ſhall my minister be.</hi> But our Lord promiſed to the thiefe not only his preſence or company, but further added, that the <hi>Thiefe</hi> ſhould be in Paradiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:14178:32"/>
               <p>What the word <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in this place may ſignify (notwithſtanding the different opinions of ſome) nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not be diſputed of. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that Chriſt the ſame day after his death, was with his Body in the Sepulcher, with his Soule in Hell: for thus much the Creede of our Fayth deliuereth to vs. It is alſo no leſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the Name either of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall or Terreſtriall <hi>Paradiſe</hi> cannot be aſcribed either to the Graue, or to Hell. Not to the Graue; becauſe that was a moſt narrow &amp; ſtrait place, only fitting to receaue and containe dead Bodies (to omit, that the Body of Chriſt &amp; the Body of the good Thiefe were not put in one and the ſame graue;) Therefore it followeth, that if the <hi>Graue</hi> had beene vnderſtood in this place, that promiſe had not bene fulfilled, <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me.</hi> Neither can the Name of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> be aptly applyed to <hi>Hell;</hi> ſeing <hi>Paradiſe</hi> doth ſignify a garden of delights. And certainly in the terreſtriall Paradiſe, there were trees, bearing fruite and flowers; there were alſo moſt cleare Waters, and an incredible ſweetnes of Ayre. And in the celeſtiall Paradiſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14178:33"/> there were, and are immortall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, an inextinguible Light, and the ſeates of the Bleſſed. But in Hell, euen in that place, where the ſoules of the holy Fathers did ſtay, there was no light, no ſweetnes, no delight. True it is, that thoſe ſoules were not tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but rather contrariwiſe, ſeeing the hope of their future Redemption, and the Viſitation of Chriſt to come to them, did exhilerate &amp; comfort them: yet notwithſtanding this, they were detayned (as Captiues) in an obſcure and darke Priſon. For thus doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, (expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the Prophet) ſpeak: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Chriſt aſcending on high, led Captiuity captiue.</hi> And <hi>Zachary</hi> ſayth, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou in the bloud of thy Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haſt let forth thy Priſoners out of the Lake wherein is no Water.</hi> Where thoſe words, <hi>thy Priſoners,</hi> and, <hi>out of the lake in which there is no water,</hi> do not intimate any ſweetnes of Paradiſe, but the darknes of a Priſon. Therefore the name of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> ſignifieth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, then the Beatitude of the Soule, which is placed in the Viſion of God: for that is the true Paradiſe of delights; not corporall or locall, but ſpirituall and Celeſtiall.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:14178:33"/>
               <p>And this is the reaſon, why the <hi>Theefe</hi> beſeeching and ſaying: <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, when thou ſhalt come into thy kingdome.</hi> Chriſt did not anſwere and ſay: <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me in my kingdome,</hi> but, <hi>in Paradiſe;</hi> For Chriſt himſelfe vvas not to be that day in his kingdome; that is, in perfect felicity of Body and ſoule; but he was to arriue thereto vpon the day of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when his Body was to become immortall, impaſsible, glorious, and not obnoxious or ſubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct to any ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Neither would Chriſt haue the good <hi>Theefe</hi> to be partaker of this kingdome before the common Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of all Bodies, and the day of the laſt Iudgment. Notwithſtanding our Lord moſt truly and properly ſaid to him, <hi>To day thou ſhalt he with me in Paradiſe,</hi> becauſe that very day he was to communicate to the ſoule of the good thiefe, as alſo to the Soules of all the Saints in <hi>Limbo Patrum,</hi> the glory of the ſight of God, which himſelfe had receaued from his Conception. For this glory, or felicity is eſſentiall, and it is the ſupreme Good in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Paradiſe. And certainly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the words of Chriſt is to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14178:34"/> admired. For he ſaid not: <hi>VVe ſhall be to day in Paradiſe,</hi> or, <hi>to day we will goe into Paradiſe;</hi> but, <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> as if he would haue ſaid: Thou art this day with me vpon the Croſſe, but thou art not with me in Paradiſe, in which I am, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſupreme portion of the ſoule; but a litle after, yea this very day, thou ſhalt be with me, not only freed from the Croſſe, but euen in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>

               <p>FRom the <hi>ſecond Word</hi> ſpoken v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Croſſe, we may gather certaine fruits of great worth. The firſt fruit is, the Conſideration of the immenſe mercy &amp; liberality of Chriſt, and how behoofull and profitable a thing it is, to ſerue him. Chriſt being oppreſſed with dolours, and paines, might not haue heard the <hi>Theefe</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; but Charity made choyce rather to forget the ſharpnes of his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14178:34"/> torments, then not to heare a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinner, ſo confeſſing himſelfe to be. The ſame Lord, who was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilent at the maledictions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrations of the Chiefe Prieſts, and the ſouldiers, would not through his Charity be ſo, to the cryes of a poore and penitent ſuppliant.

               <p>Neither did Chriſt proceede in this manner of munificence only with this Thiefe.

So as a man of a cleare and perfect Iudgment,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14178:36"/> would ſooner make choyce to retaine and keep that ſpirituall good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then to change it for an hundred houſes, La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, or other ſuch like things.

               <p>But ſome men will conteſt againſt what we heere teach, and auer, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hauing taſted of the Riches of Chriſt, ſaying: All which is hitherto ſpoken, are but naked Words, ſince we daily ſee many ſeruants of Chriſt to be poore, abiect, contemptible, and in ſtate deplorable. This <hi>Hundred fould</hi> which is here ſo greatly magnified, vve ſee not. To this I anſwere. It is ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14178:36"/> indeed; for a Carnall man neuer ſeeth that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred fould</hi> promiſed by Chriſt; becauſe his eyes are not capable of ſuch a ſight; neither doth this man at any time taſt that ſolid and true ioy, which a pure Conſcience, and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Charity towards, God is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to taſt. But here I will produce an Example, from the which Carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Senſuality may in ſome ſort make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture of ſpirituall delights, and riches.</p>
               <p>We read in the Booke of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (<hi>diſtinct.</hi> 3. <hi>exempl.</hi> 26.) of the moſt famous men of the <hi>Cistercian Order,</hi> that one <hi>Arnulphus</hi> (noble by byrth, and of great riches) leauing the World, and abandoning from him all temporall cares, became a Monke of the forſaid Order, vnder the famous Abbot S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> This man God did exerciſe and trye with diuers moſt ſharp ſcourges of many corporall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, eſpecially tovvards the later end of his life. But at one time, when his paines began to ſeize vpon him with greater violence then vſually afore, he cryed out with a great voyce, and ſaid: <hi>Vera ſunt omnia, qua dixisti Domine Ieſu.</hi> O <hi>Lord Ieſu &amp;c. all thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14178:37"/> things are true, which thou haſt ſaid.</hi> And when as thoſe, who were about him, demaunded why he ſpake theſe Words, he replied: <hi>Dominus in Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio ſuo dicit; Qui reliquerit diuitias &amp;c. Our Lord hath ſaid in his Goſpell, He who hath left his riches, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things for Chriſt; ſhall receaue an hundred fould in this life, and after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards life euerlasting. Ego vim huius promiſsionis nunc demum intelligo &amp;c. I now at length do ſee and acknowledge the truth and force of this promiſe; and do confeſſe, that now I do receaue an hundred fould of all things, or goods, which I haue left. For the great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of theſe my paynes is ſo pleaſant and gratefull to me, through my hope of Gods good mercy of which theſe dolours are a pledge, as that I would not haue wanted this Hope and Comfort for ſo much riches of the world, though a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tymes doubled, as I haue left and forſaken. For certainly the ſpirituall ioy, which now is but in hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, doth a hundred thouſand times exceed al worldly ioy which now actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in poſſeſsion is.</hi> Thus far the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Arnulphus</hi> his words. And I would deſire the Reader maturely to

               <p>But <hi>S.

And the Croſſe of the <hi>Rich Glutton,</hi> which conſiſted in heaping together of Riches (the which our Lord moſt truly compared to thornes) was not ended in his death, as the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of <hi>Lazarus</hi> the poore beggar was; but accompanying him euen to Hell, doth burne, and torment him, and forceth him to ſay: <hi>I would to God, that a drop of Water might coole my tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am tormented in this flame.</hi> Thus we ſee, that the <hi>Croſſe</hi> of the wicked neuer findeth end.

               <p>To conclude, <hi>Salome</hi> was the wife of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> and mother of <hi>S. Iames</hi> and <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>There is alſo an other literall doubt, which here occurreth, to be ſolued; How <hi>S. Iohn</hi> can ſay, that theſe three women did ſtand <hi>iuxta crucem Domini, by ſide, or neare to the Croſſe of our Lord,</hi> ſeing <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> do write, that they did ſtand farre of from the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reconcileth theſe ſeeming different teſtimonies; ſaying that theſe holy women might be ſaid to ſtand aloofe from the Croſſe, and neare to the Croſſe. A farr off, if their ſtanding be compared to the ſouldiers and other Miniſters, who were ſo neare to the Croſſe, as that they did touch it. Neere to the Croſſe they may be ſaid to ſtand, becauſe through their neerenes they might eaſely heare the voyce and words of Chriſt; the which the common People could not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their greater diſtance. It alſo may be further ſaid, that thoſe three holy Women, during the Paſsion did ſtand farre of the Croſſe, as being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the common People and the ſouldiers; but a litle after the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion was accompliſhed, &amp; many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting away, thoſe three wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14178:48"/> 
                  <hi>S. Iohn</hi> did draw more neere vnto the Croſſe. But againſt this may be vrged; that ſuppoſing this conſtruction, how could then the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> vnderſtand, that thoſe words of our Lord, <hi>This is thy Sonne, This is thy Mother, were ſpoken of them,</hi> ſeing a great company of perſons were there preſent, and Chriſt did not call either the Virgin, or the Diſciple by their proper name, or appellation?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwere, that thoſe three Womon and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> did ſtand ſo neere vnto the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> as that our Lord might eaſily deſigne and point out with his eyes the perſons, to whom he did ſpeake; eſpecially ſeing it is certaine he directed thoſe words to ſuch as were his friends, and not to ſtrangers. Now among thoſe, who were his owne friends, there was no other man there preſent, to whom he could ſay, <hi>This is thy Mother,</hi> then <hi>S. Iohn;</hi> nor any other VVoman, who through death was depriued of her ſonne, then the B <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi> Therefore he ſaid to his Mother: <hi>Behould thy Sonne,</hi> and to his Diſciple: <hi>Behould thy Mother;</hi> Of which words this is the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe &amp; meaning I now paſſe out of this VVorld to my Father and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14178:49"/> becauſe I know thou art my <hi>Mother,</hi> and that thou haſt neither parents, nor husband, nor brethren, nor ſiſters; therefore not to leaue thee deſtitute of all humane comfort and ayde, I do commend thee to the charge and care of <hi>Iohn</hi> my moſt deare Diſciple. He ſhalbe to thee in place of a Sonne, and thou to him in place of a Mother. Which wholſome counſell, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt did greatly pleaſe them both, and ech of them (as is credible) accepted thereof with a yealding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of head and body. And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe ſayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>And from that houre, the Diſciple tooke her for his owne: Ioan.</hi> 19.

               </p>
               <p>But now here ariſeth another li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall doubt, <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was one of thoſe who ſaid: <hi>Ecce nos relinquimus omnia &amp;c.

In this ſence therefore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did leaue Father and Mother, when they did not ſtand in neede of his labour and care; But he did vndergoe the charge and ſollicitude of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> the Mother, at the command of Chriſt, becauſe ſhe was depriued of all humane help and conſolation. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could eaſily without mans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, haue prouided by the miniſtery of his Angels, all things which were neceſſary for maintayning of her life: (for to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe the Angels did miniſter in the deſert) yet it was his good pleaſure thus to proceed with S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that ſo he might leaue this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſuccour to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> &amp; alſo thereby honour S <hi>Iohn.</hi> For God ſent <hi>Elias</hi> to prouide and take care of the Widow, not that he could not nouriſh and feede her by the Help of the Crowes, as before he had done, but that God might thereby more bleſſe the Widow, as <hi>S.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14178:50"/> then any of the reſt of his Diſciples. For in this mutation &amp; change of the Mother, is fulfilled that Sentence: <hi>He who hath left his Father and Mother &amp;c. ſhall receaue an hundred fould, and ſhall poſſeſſe life euerlasting. Math.</hi> 19. For he truly receaued an hundred fould, who left his mother, being the wyfe of a poore fiſher, and receaued to his care, as Mother, the Mother of the Creatour, the Lady of the World, being full of Grace, and bleſſed among all Women, and after to be exalted to the Celeſtiall Kingdome, aboue all the Quyres of Angels.</p>

               <p>To conclude, thoſe who are in ſtate of Perfection, liuing a ſingle and vnmaried life (eſpecially if they be Virgins) as the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> the Mother of Chriſt, and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diſciple of Chriſt, and beloued of him aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>IN this third place we learne from the Chayre of the Croſſe, and from the words of Chriſt ſpoken to his Mother, and his Diſciple, what is the duty of God Parents towards their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nes, and reciprocally of good ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towards their Parents. We will begin with the firſt. Good Parents ought to loue their Sonnes, yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14178:55"/> and proportion their loue to them, as that it may be no impediment to the Loue of the Parents towards God. And this is that, vvhich our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour teacheth in the Goſpell; <hi>He that loueth his Sonne or his daughter more then me, is not worthy of me. Math.</hi> 10. This Precept the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely obſerued. For ſhe ſtayed neere to the <hi>Croſse</hi> with great Griefe, and with great Conſtancy. Her Griefe did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the extremity of her loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her Sonne, hanging vpon the Croſſe: her Conſtancy did teſtify her great obſeruance and duty towards God, reigning in Heauen. She did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould her innocent ſonne with great anxiety and care of mind (whom ſhe ſo dearely loued) ſuffering moſt bitter dolours and paines, yet did ſhe not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour either in words or action to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe his afflictions (though ſhe could) becauſe ſhe did well know, that her Sonne was to vndergoe all thoſe torments, by the defined Counſell, &amp; prouidence of God the Father.</p>
               <p>Loue is the Meaſure of Griefe; therefore the Mother did much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to behould her ſonne to be ſo cruciated and afflicted, ſince ſhe loued
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14178:56"/> him much. And how could it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, but that the <hi>Virgin</hi> (the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt) ſhould moſt ardently loue her ſonne; ſince ſhe was well pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, that her ſonne did exceede all the ſonnes of men, in euery degree of Prayſe, and that her ſonne was in a more ſtrict bond to her, and did more nearely belong to her, then any other ſonnes do belong vnto their Mothers. The reaſon why Women do loue their ſonnes, is accuſtomed to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. The one is, in that they bare and brought their ſonnes forth into the World; The other in that the ſonnes become famous for their deportment and good deſerts For otherwiſe there are not Mothers wanting, who do but litle loue, or rather hate their ſonns, if either they be of any deformity in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or do proue wicked, or vngratefull and vnnaturali towards their Parents,</p>
               <p>Now the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> (the mother of Chriſt) loued her Sonne for both theſe reſpects in a more intenſe and high degree, then any other Mother euer loued her ſonne. For firſt, Other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alone do not generate children, but in the generation of them they haue their husband for their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14178:56"/> in that Act. But the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin alone did generate her ſonne; <hi>Since a Virgin did beget, and a Virgin did bring forth.</hi> And as Chriſt (our Lord) in his diuine generation had a Father without a Mother; ſo in his humane generation he had a Mother, without a Father. And although it may be truly ſaid, that Chriſt was conceaued of the Holy Ghoſt, yet the Holy Ghoſt is not the Father of Chriſt, but the Effectour and maker of the Body of Chriſt. Neither did the Holy Ghoſt frame the body of Chriſt, of his owne proper ſubſtanee, which peculiarly belongeth to a Father; but he formed it of the moſt pure bloud of the Virgin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the company of a Father, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and bring forth her Sonne. And ſhe alone doth challenge her Sonne, as whole to herſelfe; and thereupon did more loue him, then any other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer loued her Oſpring.</p>
               <p>Novv ſo far forth as belongeth to the ſecond Reaſon: The ſonne of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> was, and is ſpecious, and beautifull <hi>aboue the ſonnes of men;</hi> and doth excell both men and Angels in all manner of prayſe. Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14178:57"/> that the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> who loued her Sonne aboue all others, did alſo condole and deplore his death &amp; paſsion more, then all others. This point is ſo vndeniable, as that S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> is not afraid to ſay, that the Griefe of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> conceaued tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Paſsion of her So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, might be called the Martyrdome of her Hart, according to that of <hi>S. Simeon; Thy owne ſoule ſhall a ſword pierce.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the martyrdome of the Hart ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more intollerable, then the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome of the Body; S. <hi>Anſelme</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the dolours of the <hi>B. Virgin</hi> were more ſharpe and inſufferable, then any corporall martyrdome. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our Sauiour, when praying in the garden of <hi>Gethſemani,</hi> he ſuffered his hart to be martyred, and ſtrongly apprehending all the paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the next day he was to vndergoe, and withall giuing (as it were) the reines and liberty to griefe and feare, began ſo vehemently to be cruciated and afflicted, as that a bloudy ſweat diſtilled from his whole Body; The which is not read to haue fallen out in his corporall Paſsion.</p>
               <p>Therfore the <hi>B, Virgin</hi> doubtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14178:57"/> ſuffered moſt bitter paine, and acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity of affliction, through the ſword of Dolour penetrating her ſoule. And yet in that ſhe was moſt willing, that the honour and glory of God ſhould ouer weigh the loue, which ſhe did beare to the fleſh of Chriſt; therefore ſhe ſtood neere vnto the Croſſe, full of all conſtancy and ſpirituall reſolution, looking without any ſhew of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience vpon her Sonne then ſuffering. She did not fall vpon the Earth, halfe dead (as ſome do imagine;) ſhe did not teare the hayre from her Heade; ſhe did not after a womaniſh manner bewaile and crye out; but ſhe entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; welcomed with all eauenneſſe and ſerenity of mind, what was to be tollerated, as proceeding from the good pleaſure and Will of God. She greatly loued the fleſh of her ſonne; ſhe more loued the honour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; ſaluation of the World; which two points the Sonne himſelfe did more loue, then the ſafety and health of his owne Body. Furthermore, the aſſured Fayth of the Reſurrection of her Sonne, to be after the third day (of the which ſhe neuer doubted) did ſo animate her, and miniſter new ſpirits
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14178:58"/> of Conſtancy, as that ſhe did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tand in need of humane Conſolation. For ſhe knew well, that the death of her Sonne, was like vnto a moſt ſhort ſleepe, according to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>I haue ſlept, and haue bene at rest; and I haue riſen vp, becauſe our Lord hath taken me. Pſal.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>All good &amp; pious Chriſtians ought to imitate this Example; I meane, they ought to loue their Children; but not to prefer them in loue before God, who is the Father of all, and who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them better, and in a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner, then we know how to loue. And firſt Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought to loue their Sonnes with a manly &amp; prudent loue; not boulſtering or encouraging them when they do euill; but bringing them vp in the feare of God; and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them not only with words, but euen with ſtrokes, if either they offend God, or neglect their ſtudies, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For this is the will of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in the Holy Scriptures, as <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Haſt thou children? Inſtruct them, and bow them from their childhood.</hi> And we read of Toby, that, <hi>he taught his Sonne from his infancy to feare God, and to abstaine
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14178:58"/> from all ſinne.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. admoniſheth Fathers, that they do not prouoke their Children to anger, but do bring them vp in diſcipline &amp; correction of our Lord; that is, that they vſe them not as ſeruants, but as freemen. For thoſe who beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer ſeuerely, and auſterely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Children, continually checking or ſtriking them for the leaſt fault, do treate them as bondſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ues; ſo cauſing them either to be of a baſe and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iected diſpoſition, or els to fly away from their Parents. Now thoſe, who are ouer indulg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nt, do make their Children wicked; nouriſhing &amp; brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them vp, not for the kingdome of God, but for Hell.</p>
               <p>The true way for the education of Children, is, that Parents do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in diſcipline, ſo as they may learne willingly and promptly to obey their Parents and maiſters; and when they do erre and offend, that they do correct them paternally, that ſo the Sonnes may vnderſtand themſelues to be chaſtized out of Loue, not out of Hate. Furthermore, if ſo it ſhall pleaſe God to call any of them to the Clergy, or to ſome religious Order, let not the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14178:59"/> Parents reſiſt ſo good a reſolution, for feare they may reſiſt God, who is the firſt Father of all men; but let them ſay with holy Iob. <hi>Our Lord gaue, and our Lord hath taken away; The name of our Lord be bleſsed.</hi> To conclude, if children be taken from their Parents by vntimely death (the which thing did c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I heere come to the duty of a Sonne towards Parents, the which Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, performed in a moſt full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner toward his Mother.

                  </gap>re our Lord accompliſhed the function of a Sonne moſt fully towards his Mother; and this ſeuerall wayes. For firſt he aſſigned to her a Sonne who being of the ſame age with Chriſt (or rather a yeare yonger) was moſt fitting to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the charge and care of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord.</p>
               <p>He furthermore out of the twelue Apoſtles, made choice of him to this incumbency and labour, whome our Lord himſelfe chiefly loued, and of whome he alſo did know himſelfe to be greatly againe beloued; therefore he might well repoſe greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and truſt in him, touching his diligence towards his Mother. Againe, our Lord aſſigned him, whome he knew was to liue very many yeares, and therefore without any doubt to ouer liue his Mother. To conclude, our Lord was not wanting in his duty to his Mother euen at that tyme, when
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14178:60"/> his thoughts were to be buſied, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his owne anxieties and dolours. For at that tyme a man might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neuertheles his charity towards his mother ouercame him, and ſo litle regarding his owne ſtate, his care was touching the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and comfort of his mother; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the expectation of the prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptitude and fidelity of <hi>S.

               <p>This Prouidence, which Chriſt had towards his Parent, ought with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon to be performed by other Sons towards their Parents. For Chriſt did leſſe owe to his Parent, then other men do their Parents. Other men are ſo obliged to their Parents, as that they are neuer able to requite it. For they owe their life to them, for which the Sons cannot make any iuſt ſatisfaction. <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> ſaith: <hi>remember that thou hadſt not beene borne, but for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Neither hath God only annexed a reward to thoſe, who honour their Parents; but alſo hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned a Puniſhment to ſuch, that do not honour them.

And <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> addeth: <hi>He, who exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth his Mother, is accurſed of God. Eccl.</hi> 3 And hence it appeareth, that the Malediction, and curſing of the Parents againſt their Children, hath a great force, in that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the ſame. Of which point no few Examples are extant in Hiſtories; of which, one moſt notorious and remarkable is recorded by S. <hi>Austin,</hi> the ſumme and contents whereof is this: In <hi>Caeſaria</hi> a Citty of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> there were ten Children (to wit, ſeauen ſonnes, and three daughters:) who being accurſed by their Mother, inſtantly, euen by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, they were ſurprized with ſuch a payne and dolour, as that all of them were horribly ſtrooken and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a trembling of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: In which moſt loathſome ſtate
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14178:62"/> they, not brooking the daily ſight of their owne Cittizens, wandred vp and downe throughout the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; Two of theſe at the length were cured in the preſence and ſight of <hi>S.

                  </gap>fficulties are in this place to be diſcuſſed, and ſolued: for firſt the Sunn is accuſtomed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Eclipſe of its light, in the New
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14178:68"/> moone, when the moone is found to be betweene the Sunne and the earth; the which could not be at the time of the death of Chriſt; ſeeing the moone at that tyme was not in coniunction with the Sunne, which falleth out in the new moone; but was in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which happeneth in the full moone. For all that tyme the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> or Feaſt of Eaſter was celebrated by the Iewes, which according to the Law, began vpon the foureteenth day of the firſt Month. Againe admitting, that at the Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, the Moone had beene in coniunction with the Sunne; yet from hence it followeth not, that there could be darknes for the ſpace of three houres, that is, from the ſixt houre to the nynth: ſince the Eclipſe of the Sunne cannot continue long, eſpecially if it be a full Eclipſe and ſuch as may hide the whole: Body of the Sunne, ſo as the obſcurity of it may be accounted darknes. For the moone is more ſwift in motion, then the ſunne, in regard of the moones proper motion; and conſequently can darken the ſunne but for a very ſhort tyme. For the Moone inſtantly doth begin to goe backe, and leaueth the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14178:69"/> ſunne free, that ſo it may illuminate the Earth with its accuſtomed light &amp; ſplendour. To conclude, it can neuer ſo fall out, that through the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Moone, the ſunne ſhould leaue the whole Vniuerſall Earth in darknes.

               </p>
               <p>But theſe difficulties may eaſely be explicated. For firſt, where it is ſaid in the beginning, that the Eclypſe of the ſunne is accuſtomed to be in the New moone only, &amp; not in the full moone, this is true, when a Naturall defect of the light of the ſunne happeneth. But at the death of Chriſt, the defect of the ſunne was vniuerſall and prodigious,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14178:70"/> which could be wrought only by him, who made the ſunne, the Moone, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and Earth. For <hi>S. Dionyſius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the place aboue noted, that the Moone was ſeene by himſelfe, and by <hi>Apollophanes</hi> about the midtyme of the day, after an vnaccuſtomed &amp; moſt ſwift motion to come to the Sunne, and lying vnder it, there remained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, vntill the ninth hower, and then returned backe towards the Orient, to its owne place.</p>
               <p>To that, which is added aboue; to wit, that the defect of the ſunnes light could not ſo remaine for the ſpace of three Howers, as that during all that tyme the Earth ſhould be in darknes; it may be anſwered hereto, that this is true, if we ſpeake of a naturall, and vſuall defect of the ſunne. But this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clypſe of the ſunne was not gouerned by the lawes, or ſetled courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the Will of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Creatour, who as he could bring the moone after a wonderfull manner from the Eaſt, in a moſt rapid and ſwift motion to the ſunne, and after three howers ended, could bring it back to its owne place in the Orient; ſo alſo was of power to cauſe, that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14178:70"/> moone ſhould remaine immoueable vnder the ſunne for thoſe three how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and that it ſhould not mooue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſlowly or more ſwiftly, then the ſunne it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, where aboue is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Eclypſe and defect of the ſunne could not be obſerued &amp; ſeene through out the Vniuerſall Earth, in regard that the Moone is leſſer then the Earth, &amp; farre more leſſe in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity then the ſunne; I grant this to be moſt true, with reference to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the moone, only. But what the moone could not performe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Creatour of the ſunne &amp; moone performed, only in not cooperating with the ſunne in illuſtrating &amp; ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Earth: For things created can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke or performe their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, except the Creatour do aſſiſt &amp; cooperate with them. And whereas ſome men ſay, that darknes might the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made throughout the whole Earth, through a condenſation, and thickning of blacke and miſty Cloudes; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be truly auerred, ſince it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the teſtimonies of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that in the tyme of that Eclyps and darknes, the ſtars were ſeene to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14178:71"/> appeare and ſhine in Heauen: But thick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now why God would haue this ſigne of <hi>Darknes</hi> to happen at the Paſsion of Chriſt, ſeuerall Reaſons are accuſtomed to be alledged, but two chiefly.

Therefore the whole World was amazed, and through hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the fact trembled; And the ſunne it ſelfe as vnwilling to lend its light to the furtherance of perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo flagitious a Crime, did with draw in its beames, couering the whole ayre with blacke and dreadfull darknes.</p>
               <p>But let vs now deſcend to the words of our Lord: <hi>Eli, Eli, lamma ſabactani,</hi> Theſe words are taken from
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14178:72"/> the beginning of the one &amp; twentith Pſalme, where we thus read: <hi>Deus, Deus meus, reſpice in me, quare me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliquisti?</hi> O <hi>God, my God, haue reſpect to me, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Where thoſe words, <hi>reſpice in me,</hi> vvhich are in the middeſt of the Verſe, were added by the Septuagint Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters; for in the Hebrew Text, there are no other words, but thoſe, which our Lord did ſpeake. In this one point the words of the Pſalme, and of Chriſt do differ; in that the Words of the Pſalme are all Hebrew words, whereas thoſe ſpoken by Chriſt, are partly <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riach</hi> words, which kind of tongue the Iewes did then much vſe. For thoſe words: <hi>Talitha cumi, id est, puella ſurge</hi> and, <hi>Ephetha,</hi> that is, <hi>ad apetite,</hi> and ſome others in the Ghoſpels, are <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riake</hi> words, and not <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But to proceed.

               <p>This dereliction and forſaking of Chriſt by his Father may be vnderſtood in fiue ſeuerall ſenſes or wayes, of all waith but one is true. There were fiue
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14178:72"/> coniunctions of God in the Son. One naturall and eternall; to wit, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the <hi>Perſon</hi> with the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Sonne in Eſſence. Another, that is, a new coniunction of the <hi>Diuine nature,</hi> with the <hi>Humane nature</hi> in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the Sonne; or, which is all one, a coniunction of the diuine <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the Sonne, with the humane <hi>Nature.</hi> The third, was the <hi>Vnion of Grace</hi> and of will; for Chriſt being ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was <hi>full of grace and truth, Ioan.</hi> 1. And, <hi>the things that do pleaſe God, he did allwayes,</hi> as himſelfe witneſſeth in <hi>S. Iohn. cap.</hi> 8. And the Father more then once ſaid of him: <hi>This is my bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Sonne, in whome I am well pleaſed. Matth.</hi> 3. The fourth coniunction was the <hi>Vnion of Glory;</hi> for the ſoule of Chriſt did ſee God, euen from his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. The fifth was the <hi>Vnion of Protection,</hi> of which himſelfe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, when he ſaith: <hi>He that ſent me, is with me, and he hath not left me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, Ioan.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt Vnion is altogether inſeparable and perpetuall; becauſe it is an Vnion in <hi>Diuine Eſſence,</hi> of which himſelfe ſpeaketh: <hi>I and my Father are on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> And therefore Chriſt did not ſay,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14178:73"/> 
                  <hi>my Father, why hast thou left me?</hi> For the Father is not called the <hi>God</hi> of the Sonne, till after the Incarnation, and by reaſon of the Incarnation. The ſecond Vnion is neuer diſſolued, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be diſſolued; for what God once aſſumed, he neuer did leaue; for the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>He ſpared not his own Sonn, but for vs all deliuered him. Rom.</hi> 8. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter: Christ ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs;</hi> And, <hi>Chriſt ſuffering in fleſh.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 4. All which ſacred teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies demonſtrate, that he, who was crucifyed, was not pure man, but the true Sonne of God, and our Lord Chriſt. The third Vnion doth in lyke ſort euer remaine, and euer ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: <hi>The iust dyed for the vniust,</hi> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſpeaketh 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. And the death of Chriſt would haue profited vs nothing, if the <hi>Vnion of Grace</hi> ſhould be diſſolued. The fourth Vnion could not be diſſolued, becauſe the Beatitude of the Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e cannot be loſt, ſince it comprehendeth an aggregation and heaping together of all goods. For the ſoule of Chriſt according to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part, was truly Bleſſed; of which Point ſee <hi>S Thomas</hi> 3. <hi>p. q.</hi> 46. <hi>art.</hi> 8. Therefore there remaineth onely the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14178:73"/> 
                  <hi>vnion of Protection,</hi> which for a ſhort tyme was broken, that the Oblation of the bloudy Sacrifice ſhould take place, for the redemption of mankind.</p>
               <p>True it is, that God the Father could haue protected Chriſt many waies, and hindred his Paſſion; for according heerto Chriſt ſaid in his prayer, which he made in the garden: <hi>Father, all things are poſsible to thee, transferre this Chalce from me; but not that which I will, but that which thou. Marc.</hi> 14. And to <hi>S. Peter</hi> Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Thinketh thou, that I cannot aske my Father; and he will giue me preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more then twelue legions of Angels?</hi> againe, Chriſt might, as God, haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected his fleſh that it ſhould not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Ioan.</hi> 10. <hi>No man taketh my lyfe from me, but I yield it vp of myſelfe,</hi> The which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> prophecyed, when he ſaid. <hi>cap.</hi> 53. <hi>He wat offered, becauſe himſelfe would.</hi> To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, the bleſſed foule of Chriſt could haue traſmitted, and powred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its body the guift of impaſſibility and incorruption; but it pleaſed the <hi>Father,</hi> it pleaſed the <hi>Word,</hi> it pleaſed the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to ſuffer (for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the common Decree) that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14178:74"/> mans force ſhould for a tyme preuaile againſt Chriſt. For this was that houre, of which our Lord ſpake to thoſe, who came to take him: <hi>This is your houre, and the power of darknes. Luc.</hi> 22. In this manner therefore God did leaue his Sonne, when he ſuffered, that the humane fleſh of his Sonne ſhould ſuffer moſt bitter griefes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſolation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Chriſt crying with a great voice, did manifeſt this dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that all men thereby ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the greatnes of the pryce of the Redemption of man kind: for till that very houre he ſuffered all things with ſuch incredible patience, and indifferency of mynd, as if he had wanted all ſenſe and feeling: for fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe agrieued and wronged by the Iewes, he did not charge <hi>Pilate,</hi> who prononced ſentence againſt him, nor the ſouldiers who nayled him to the Croſſe He did not lament, he did not bewayle, or ſhew any ſigne of dolour. Therefore when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching neere to his death, to the end that mankind ſhould vnderſtand, and particularly that we (his ſeruants) ſhould not be vngratefull for ſo great
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14178:74"/> a fauour; and that we ſhould magnify the pryce and worth of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was willing that the dolours of his Paſſion ſhould publikely, and openly be knowne. Wherefore thoſe words, <hi>My God, why hast thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> are not words of accuſation, or indignation, or complaint; but (as I haue ſaid) they are words declaring with moſt iuſt reaſon, and in a moſt fit tyme, the greatnes of Chriſt his Paſſion.</p>

               <p>VVE haue briefly expounded thoſe things, which belong to the <hi>fourth Word,</hi> according to the Hiſtory. Now we will gather ſome fruits from the tree of the Croſſe. Firſt that conſideration doth preſent it ſelfe vnto vs; to wit, that Chriſt would drinke vp the whole Chalice of his Paſſion, euen to the laſt drop. He was to remaine vpon the Croſſe three hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, from the ſixt houre to the ninth.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14178:75"/> He remained full three whole houres and aboue; for before the ſixt houre he was nayled to the Croſſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ninth houre, he gaue vp the Ghoſt. This point may be made eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this Reaſon; the Eclyps of the Sunne began in the ſixt houre, as three Euangeliſts do teach, <hi>Matthew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> And <hi>Marke</hi> in expreſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſayth: <hi>when it was the ſixt houre, there was made darknes vntil the ninth houre.</hi> The firſt tree <hi>VVord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> of our Lord were ſpoken vpon the Croſſe, before the beginning of the darknes; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>foure</hi> were vttered after darknes and therefore after the ninth houre, Furthermore <hi>S. Marke</hi> explicateth this point more cleerly, when he ſaith: <hi>And it was the third houre, and they crucifyed him &amp;c.</hi> And then after he ſubioyneth: <hi>And when it was the ſixt houre, there was made darknes, cap.</hi> 14. Now where he ſaith, our Lord was crucifyed in the third houre he ſignifyeth, that the third houre, was not then complete, when our Lord was crucifyed, and conſequently that the ſixt houre was not as then begun. For <hi>S. Marke</hi> numbreth three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall houres, which are accuſtomed to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14178:75"/> containe three ordinary houres. And according to this acceptance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the Houshoulder called the workmen to his vineyard, at the firſt, the third, the ſixt, the ninth, and elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth houre. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. And we doe number the Canonicall houres, to wit, the firſt, the third, the ſixt, the ninth, and the <hi>Veſpers,</hi> which is the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth houre. Therefore in <hi>S. Marke</hi> our Lord is ſaid to be crucifyed at the third houre, becauſe as then the ſixt houre was not come.</p>
               <p>From hence then it followeth that our Lord would drinke the chalice of his Paſſion in a moſt full and copious manner; thereby to teach vs to loue better the cup of Pennance &amp; labour; and not to loue and affect the cup of ſecular conſolations and delights. We by the law of the fleſh and the world, do deſire and vviſh for little Pennance and great Indulgence, ſmall labour and much conſolation, ſhort Prayer and long chatting, or diſcourſe. But certainly vve knovv not vvhat vve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ſince the Apoſtle admoniſheth vs; <hi>euery one ſhall receaue his reward, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his labour.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.

Euerlaſting felicity is doubtleſly worth euerlaſting labour; but becauſe, if euerlaſting labour had beene abſolutly neceſſary thereto, we ſhould neuer haue attained to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting felicity; therefore our mercyfull Lord was content, that onely in this life (which flyeth away like a ſhadow) we ſhould labour according to our ſtrength, in good workes, and in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequy and obedience towards him. And therefore thoſe men are without hart or courage, without vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, without iudgment, and are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infants, and children, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and waſt this ſhort tyme in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and which is farre more deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in grieuouſly offending, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking Gods wrath and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.

               <p>ANother fruit may be gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conſideration of the ſilence of Chriſt in thoſe three houres, which was from the <hi>ſixt houre</hi> to the <hi>ninth. O my ſoule,</hi> vvhat did thy Lord in thoſe three houres? Horrour &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes did inuolue the vniuerſall World:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14178:77"/> And thy Lord did not repoſe himſelfe vpon a ſof bed; but did hang vpon the Croſſe, naked, full of dolours, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any comforter. Thou <hi>O Lord,</hi> who only didſt know, and try this, teach thy poore Seruants, that they may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how much they are obliged and indebted to thee; that at leaſt they may compaſsionate thee with their teares, and learne in this their exile, ſometimes to want all conſolation for thy Loue, if ſo thou ſhalt thinke it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</p>
               <p>Say to ſuch: O <hi>my Sonne,</hi> Neuer during the whole courſe of my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life (which was nothing, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paine) did I ſuffer greater &amp; more vehement ſtraits, deſolation, &amp; anxiety, then during the ſpace of thoſe three houres. And neuer did I tolerate any paines with greater willingnes and promptitude of mind, then I did at that tyme. For then by reaſon of the weight and wearines of my Body, my wounds were more inlarged, and the ſharpnes of my gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fe more increaſed. Then, euen through the abſence of the heate of the ſunne, the coldnes of the ayre more inſufferably augmented the torments of my Body, being on

Then the very dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it ſelfe, which did take away from myne eyes the ſight of Heauen, Earth, and all other things, forced my ſoule in a ſort, more vehemently &amp; intenſly to thinke vpon the paines and angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of my Body: ſo in regard of theſe aggrauating Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, thoſe three Houres did ſeeme to me to be three yeares.

So as thoſe three Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res (in regard of the greatnes of my deſire of ſuffering) appeared to be to me but three ſmall moments of Time.</p>
               <p>O moſt <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi> if the matter ſtandeth thus, then are we moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, to whom it ſeemes painfull to ſpend but one ſhort houre in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of thoſe thy dolours; when to thee it was not painfull, to hange v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Croſſe for our Redemption three whole houres, in a horrour of darknes, in cold, and nakednes, in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14178:78"/> extreme thirſt, and in moſt bitter and cruell torments. But, O <hi>Louer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> tell me, whether the vehem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncy of thy dolour, was ſo forcible, as to cauſe thee to deſiſt in hart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer, during thy long ſilence of thoſe three houers? For we being in anguiſh and tribulation (eſpecially if the members of our Body labour with any violent paine) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not without great endeauour apply our mynd to pray. But I heare thee ſay; <hi>Not ſo my Sonne;</hi> for euen in the infirmity of my fleſh, I diſpoſed my ſpirit prompt to prayer; yea during thoſe three howers, in which I ſpake nothing, I was ſtill praying with the mouth of my Hart to my <hi>Father</hi> for you. Neither did I pray only in Hart, but euen in woundes and bloud. For behould, how many wounds there were made in my body, ſo many cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voyces there were to my Father for you. And how many drops of Bloud there were, ſo many tongues they were, beſeeching and begging Mercy for you, at the hands of my foreſaid Father, and yours.</p>
               <p>But now, O Lord, thou doſt euen confound the impatience of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who if perhaps wearied out with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14178:78"/> labour, or griefe of Body, he do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to Prayer, can ſcarſly lift vp his Soule to God to pray for him, or if through thy Grace he be able to raiſe himſelfe to ſo pious an Exerciſe; yet he is not able to maintaine his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention therin for any long time; ſince his mind is euer reflecting backe to his labour &amp; paine. Therfore O <hi>pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lord,</hi> take mercy of thy Seruant according to the great Mercy, that hauing ſo great an Example of thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſet before his Eyes, he may learne to tread thy ſteps, and may at leaſt ouercome his ſmall troubles and moleſtations in tyme of Prayer.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce, which Chriſt did cancell by his Paſsion, is in ſome
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14178:79"/> reſpect <hi>Infinite;</hi> to wit, in regard of the Perſon offended, who is of infinite dignity and excellency. In like ſort, the Perſon ſatisfying (who is the Sonne of God) is alſo of <hi>infinite</hi> Dignity and Excellency; and by reaſon hereof eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry payne willingly endured by the Sonne of God (though it were only a drop of bloud) might be ſufficient for the ſatisfaction. This aſſertion is moſt true; neuertheleſſe that mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption might be full and copious; and becauſe it was not one Offence, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable Offences (for the <hi>Lambe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> vvho taketh away the ſinnes of the world, did take vpon him not only the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> but all the ſinnes of all men) therefore it pleaſed God, that his Sonne ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate innumerable paines, and thoſe moſt grieuous. And this is ſignified in that dereliction, of which the Sonne ſpeaketh to the Father: <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reaſon or cauſe was, the greatnes and multitude of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, the which to make more knowne and euident to vs, the Sonne of God would abate and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te of thoſe flames with

How great and dreadfull the fyar of Hell is, the Prophet I <hi>ſay</hi> teacheth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is altogether intollerable: <hi>which of you can dwell with deuouring fyre? which of you ſhall dwell with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting heates? Iſa.</hi> 33. Therefore let vs render thankes to God with all our Hart and powers of our Soule, who would forſake his only begotten Sonne being in moſt great griefes for a time, that he might free vs from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting heates of fire. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, let vs render all due thankes and gratefull a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. The third cauſe is the greatnes of the price of the diuine grace, which is that precious pearle, the which Chriſt (the moſt wiſe merchant) with ſale of all he had, did buy, and reſtore to vs, The grace of Chriſt, which was giuen to vs in <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; which through the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> we loſt, was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Pearle or Margarite, as that it
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14178:80"/> did wonderfully adorne vs, and made vs moſt aceptable to God, and was a pledge of eternall felicity. There was not any, who could recouer this Pearle, being the ſumme of our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and taken from vs by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but only the ſonne of God, who through his Wiſdome ouercommeth the malice of the deuil; but this with moſt great inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to himſelfe, by being expoſed to many labours and paines. Thus did the Piety and Charity of the Sonne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, who committed himſelfe willingly to a moſt labourſome iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and moſt weariſome peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thereby to redeeme the Pearle for vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Cauſe was the moſt eminent greatnes of the Kingdome of Heauen, to the which the Sonne of God opened a way, and paſſage for vs, by his immenſe labours and paines; of which point the Church of God with a gratefull remembrance thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: <hi>Tu deuicto mortis aculeo, ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruiſti credentibus regna caelorum. Thou, the sting of death being ouercome, haſt opened to the faythfull the kingdome of Heauen.</hi> And that he might ouercome
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14178:81"/> the ſting of death, it was needfull, that he ſhould ſtriue, and fight in a moſt cruell War with death; in which War the Father did forſake him, that with greater glory he might triumph.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Cauſe was the immenſe Loue, with the which the Sonne did affect his Father; for the Sonne did wiſh &amp; couet, that in the redemption of the World, and abolition of ſinne, he might ſatisfy the Honour of his eternall Father moſt copiouſly, and moſt abundantly. But this could not be effected, except the Father had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken his Sonne; that is, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſuffered him to endure all thoſe torments, which could be exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated by the Deuill, and tolerated by man. Therefore now if it be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, why God did (as it were) abandon his Sonne, ſuffering all Extremities vpon the Croſſe? it may be anſwered, that this was done to the end, that the greatnes of ſinne, the greatnes of Hel, the greatnes of diuine Grace, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Eternall life, and the greatnes of the Charity of the Sonne of God towards his Father, might more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly and manifeſtly appeare.</p>
               <p>From the conſideration of which

                  </gap>th its ſolution; That is, why God to many Martyrs did temper the Cup of their Paſsions and death, with ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſpirituall conſolation, as that thoſe Martyrs had rather drinke the Cup of their ſufferings with the mixture of thoſe internall Comforts, then without thoſe comforts to want the Cup of their Paſsions and Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; And yet contrarywiſe he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his moſt beloued Sonne to drinke vp euen to the dregs (as I may ſay) his moſt bitter Cup, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation whatſoeuer? The reaſon of the diſparity of Gods proceeding her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is, in that in the holy Martyrs not any of the former Cauſes did take place; which in the Paſsion of Chriſt we haue aboue mentioned.</p>

The demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſarily reſulteth out of foure Truths.</p>
               <p>The firſt Truth is, that when Chriſt was crucifyd the Sunne was ſo wholy obſcured that the ſtarres vvere then ſeene in the Heauens, as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be ſeene in the night. This truth is warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and confirmed by fyue witneſſes, moſt worthy of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and beliefe; who being of ſeuerall nations, liuing at ſeuerall tymes, and in ſeuerall places, when they wrote their bookes, could not write what in thoſe tymes happened out of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conuention or mutuall agreement among themſelues. The firſt is S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> an Hebrew, who did write in <hi>Iewry,</hi> &amp; was one of thoſe that ſaw the Sunne obſcured. And certainely this
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14178:82"/> man being graue and wiſe, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue written this in <hi>Iewry</hi> (and as it is credible euen in the Citty of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>) if it had not beene moſt true: ſince otherwiſe, in ſetting downe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, vvhich all men did knovv to be falſe, he might deſeruedly be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and derided of all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and of all <hi>Iewry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond vvitnes is <hi>S. Marke,</hi> vvho vvrote at <hi>Rome;</hi> and he alſo ſavv the Eclyps, becauſe then he vvas in <hi>Iewry</hi> with other diſciples of our Lord, when it happened. The third is <hi>S. Luke,</hi> who vvas a Grecian, and vvrote in <hi>Greece;</hi> and he in like ſort was an cy-vvitnes of the Eclyps at <hi>Antioch</hi> in his own Country. For vvheras <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Areopagita</hi> did ſee the Eclyps at <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in Egypt, S. <hi>Luke</hi> might more eaſily ſee it at <hi>Antioch,</hi> as being more neere to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> then <hi>Heliopolis</hi> vvas. The fourth and fifth vvitneſſes are S. <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> and <hi>Apollophanes,</hi> both Grecians, &amp; at that tyme Gentils, vvho in expreſſe vvords do teſtify, that the Eclips vvas ſeene by them vvith a ſtupendious admiration. Theſe are thoſe fiue vvitneſſes, vvho do vvarrant the truth of that Eclyps, euen from
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14178:83"/> their eyes, and ſight thereof. To theſe vve may adioine the Annalls of the ancient Romans, as alſo <hi>Phlegon</hi> the Hiſtoriographer to Adrian the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as aboue vve noted in the firſt Chapter. Therefore this firſt Truth cannot be denyed eyther by Ievves or Pagans vvithout notorious temerity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſhnes. For as concerning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, this verity belongeth to the Catholike ſayth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Truth is, that the forſaid Eclyps cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This verity is thus demonſtrated. The Sunne cannot faile in its light, but by one of theſe three vvayes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that that Eclypſe vvas vvrought vvithout any interpoſition of the moone; or that through an vnvſuall and an aſtoniſhing Miracle the moone did moue as much in fevv houres, as at other times it vvas to moue in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes; and againe that vvith the like miracle it returned backe vvith ſo great ſvviftnes that in the ſpace of ree houres it performed its motion of fourteene dayes.

               <p>The Eclypſe could not be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned after the ſecond manner; becauſe (as vve haue ſaid aboue) a thick and groſſe cloude is not of force to take from vs the ſight of the Sunne, except vvith all it take from vs the ſight of the Starres. But it is euident from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Phlegon,</hi> that the Sunne vvanting its light at the Paſſion of Chriſt, ſtarres vvere ſeene in Heauen
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14178:84"/> after the ſame manner, as they are ſeen in the night. Touching the third ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration from the tyme this darknes continued in the Ayre; for it continued as long as Chriſt our Lord did hang aliue vpon the Croſſe; that is from the ſixt hower vntill the ninth. This is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by all thoſe, who haue made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of this defection of the ſunne. Neither can it be aſcribed to chance, that this darknes (full of Miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) could caſually happen to be at the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt; ſince Miracles are not wrought by chance, but by diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14178:84"/> Neither hath there bene any Authour (that I know) that euer would attempt to aſcribe this ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull an Eclyps to any other cauſe.

               </p>
               <p>And againe in the preſence of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> who coueted to free our Lord from death, the High Prieſts and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſaid: <hi>we haue a law, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law he ought to dye, becauſe he had made himſelfe the Sonne of Cod. Ioan.</hi> 19. This therefore was the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſe, why our Sauiour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Croſſe. Which very Point was propheſied by <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>occidetur Christus &amp;c. Chriſt shall he ſlaine, and it ſhall not be his People that ſhall deny him. Dan.</hi> 9. And this was the maine motiue, why God at the Paſſion of Chriſt, did power downe ſuch dreadfull darknes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world, that thereby it might be moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly witneſſed, the High Prieſts to haue erred, the People to haue erred, <hi>Pilate</hi> to haue erred, <hi>Herod</hi> to haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and him who hanged vpon the Croſſe, to be the true Sonne of God, and the <hi>Meſsias</hi> who was promiſed.

For the <hi>Centurion</hi> did know that thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall and aſtoniſhing Prodigies, were (as it were) the Voyce of God, retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and condemning the Sentence of <hi>Caiphas</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and affirming, that that man (contrary to all Iuſtice) was deliuered ouer to death; ſeing he was the Authour of Life, the true Sonne of God, and Chriſt promiſed in the Law. For what other thing could that <hi>Darknes,</hi> being acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pained with the cleauing of the ſtones, &amp; renting of the veyle of the Sanctuary, import, but that God was auerted from a Peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple (before his) &amp; that he was highly offended; in that the <hi>People did not know the tyme of their Viſitation.

               <p>The glory of Chriſt, of which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh in the beginning of the Goſpell, when he ſayth: <hi>We ſaw the glory of him; glory as it were of the only begotten of his Father, full of grace and Verity.

All this glory his Paſsion did cloud, and obſcure, and the darkning thereof thoſe words do plainly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> The paſsion did obſcure his <hi>Power;</hi> becauſe being nayled to the Croſſe, he ſeemed to be of no power or ability; and therefore the chiefe Prieſts, ſouldiers, and the Thiefe did exprobate to him his impotency and weakenes, ſaying: <hi>Yf thou be Chriſt, come downe from the Croſſe &amp;c.</hi> And againe: <hi>He ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue.</hi> Now how great <hi>Patience,</hi> how great <hi>Humility</hi> was required, that he who was truly Omnipotent, ſhould be wholy ſilent to ſuch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braydings?</p>
               <p>The Paſsion did darken his <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14178:87"/> Prieſts, before <hi>Herod,</hi> before <hi>Pilate</hi> he anſwered nothing to many Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Queſtions, as if he had bene depriued of iudgment; by which his ſilence it was occaſioned, that <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; his Company contemned him, and cloathed him in a white veſtment by way of deriſion. How great <hi>Patience,</hi> how great <hi>Humility</hi> was heer alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for him to tolerate theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, who was not only wiſer then <hi>Salomon,</hi> but was the very Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God?</p>
               <p>His <hi>probity</hi> and Innocency of life the Paſsion obſcured; who being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified vpon the Croſſe, did hang bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene two thiefes, and was reputed a ſeducer of the People, and Vſurper of an other mans kingdome. And the ſplendour of this his <hi>Innocency,</hi> that dereliction of God, which himſelfe confeſſed, ſaying, <hi>Why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me,</hi> might well ſeeme more &amp; more to obſcure; Since God is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to forſake not pious men, but ſuch as be wicked. Certainly haughty and proud men are very cautelous to ſpeake any thing, wherby thoſe who heare them, may ſuſpect that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe any thing againſt their owne
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14178:88"/> Worth: but humble and patient men (of which ſort Chriſt was the King) willingly take bould of all occaſion of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> ſo as they ſpeake nothing, which is falſe. How great <hi>Humility,</hi> how great <hi>Patience</hi> here againe is required of him to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe things, of whom the Apoſtle thus ſpeaketh: <hi>It was fit, that we ſhould haue ſuch a Prieſt, holy, innocent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted, ſeparated from ſinners, &amp; made higher then the Heauens. Heb.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the Paſsion did ſo obſcure the Regall Maieſty of Chriſt, as that it gaue to him, for a goulden diademe, a Crovvne of thornes; for a Tribunall, a gibbet; for Princely atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, two Thieues. Therefore I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; How great <hi>Humility,</hi> how great <hi>Patience</hi> was neceſſary for him, who vvas truly the king of Kings, the Lord of Lords, and the Prince of the kings of the Earth?</p>
               <p>Now vvhat ſhall I ſay of the <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of the ſoule, which Chriſt truly had from his Conception? And the vvhich he was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Pſal.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>To this loweſt place therefore Chriſt did deſcend in his Paſsion; but this his deſcending was accompanied with great merit and exaltation. For what our Lord did often promiſe in words, ſaying: <hi>Euery one that humbleth himſelfe, ſhalbe exalted,</hi> the ſame was performed in his Perſon, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle witneſſeth: <hi>He humbled himſelfe, made obedient vnto death; euen the death of the Croſſe: for the which thing God hath alſo exalted him, and hath giuen him a Name, which is aboue all Names; That in the name of Ieſus, euery knee bow, of the Celestials, terrestrials, and Infernals.

Thus our Lord ſaid, <hi>I thirst,</hi> that the Scripture might be fulfilled. And why to the end the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled? Why did he not ſay, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> becauſe he was really, thirſty, &amp; deſired to allay his Thirſt? For the Prophet did not foretell it to the end that that ſhould fall out which he had foretould; but he did therefore fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell it, becauſe he did foreſee it after to be.

The ſumme and cloſure of all is, that as in the beginning, a litle before he vvas nailed to the Croſſe, they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him wyne mixt with gaule; ſo in

               <p>THe Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are for the moſt part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the Scriptures of the Nevv. But touching this Myſtery of the <hi>thirst</hi> of our Lord, the vvords of the ſixty eight <hi>Pſalme</hi> may vvell paraphraze, &amp; comment the Ghoſpell. We do not find clearely in the Ghoſpell, vvhether thoſe vvho offered Vineger to our Lord thirſting, did it to gratify him, or rather the more to afflict him; that is, vvhether this their action proceeded from Loue or Hate. We vvith <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> do interpret in a bad ſenſe the fact of thoſe vvho gaue to our Lord (ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thirſt) Vineger to drinke. But the vvords of the <hi>Pſalme</hi> are ſo cleere and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14178:92"/> euident as that they need not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; And from thoſe vve vvill ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this fruit, that vve may learne to thirſt vvith Chriſt after thoſe things, vvhich truly and healthfully are to be thirſted after. Theſe are the Words of the Prophet: I <hi>expected ſome body, that would be grieued with me, and there was none, or that would comfort me, and</hi> I <hi>found not any. And they gaue me gaule for my meate, &amp; in my thirſt they gaue me Vineger to drinke. Pſal.</hi> 68. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe men vvho gaue to Chriſt our Lord a litle before he vvas mayled to the Croſſe, vvine mingled vvith gaule, and thoſe vvho offered to our Lord aftervvard Vineger to drinke, vvere of that number of vvhom it is ſaid: I <hi>expected ſome body, that would be grieued with me, and there was none; and that would comfort me, and</hi> I <hi>found not any.</hi>

To conclude, were not all the Apoſtles much agrieued, &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the tyme of the Paſsion, when as Chriſt himſelfe foretould of them. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 16. <hi>The world ſhall reioyce, but you ſhall be gladde?</hi> All theſe did truly contriſtate and lament; but they did not lament together with our Lord, in that there was not the ſame reaſon of Griefe in Chriſt, and in the others. For our Lord ſayth: I <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſome body, that would be ſory with me, and there was none; and that would comfort me, and</hi> I <hi>found not any.</hi> Thoſe perſons aboueſayd did grieue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Paſſion and corporall death of Chriſt: But Chriſt did not grieue touching this point, but only for a ſhort tyme in the garden, to ſhew himſelfe to be true Man: Yea he ſaid, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. <hi>With deſire</hi> I <hi>haue deſired to eate this Paſche with you, before</hi> I <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;</hi> And in another place: <hi>Yf you loued me, you would reioyce, becauſe I goe to the Father, Ioan.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>What cauſe then of griefe was there in our Lord, in which he did not find others grieuing vvith him? To
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14178:93"/> wit, the loſſe of ſoules, for which he did ſuffer. And vvhat cauſe of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in which he had not another to comfort and reioyce with him, except the ſauing of ſoules, after which he thirſted? This one Conſolation he did ſeeke, this he deſired, of this he was euen hungry and thirſty: but gaule is giuen to him for meate, and Vineger for drinke. For the bitternes of gaule doth ſignify and figure out ſinne, then the which nothing is more bitter to him, that hath the ſenſe of Taſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or depraued; The acrimony or bitternes of Vinager repreſenteth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination in ſinne: Therfore Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly did lament, becauſe he did ſee for one <hi>Thiefe conuerted,</hi> not only an other thiefe remayning in his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; but alſo many others continuing in the like peruerſity of mind; And euen then among the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſuffering ſcandall, he ſaw <hi>S.

               <p>But Chriſt may deſeruedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of priuate men, that they do not condole with him, or with his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.

               <p>THe third fruite, which may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the words of Chriſt, is the imitation of the Patience of the Sonne of God. For although Humility (conioyned with patience) did ſhine in the <hi>Fourth word,</hi> or ſentence; yet in the <hi>Fyfth word,</hi> as in its proper and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued place, the wonderfull patience of Chriſt ſeemeth moſt eminently to manifeſt it ſelfe Patience is not only one of the chiefe Vertues; but among the reſt it is very neceſſary. For thus S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Serm. de bono Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientia. Non inuenio inter caeteras &amp;c. Among the ſeuerall wayes of Celestiall diſcipline, I do not find any thing more neceſſary to mans life, or more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to true Glory, then that we, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to obſerue the precept of our Lord with feare &amp; deuotion, ſhould carefully
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14178:99"/> deuote our ſelfes to the practice of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> But before we diſcourſe of the Neceſsity of Patience, it is needfull, that we diſtinguiſh betweene true and falſe Patience.</p>
               <p>Well then, that is true <hi>Patience,</hi> which commandeth vs to ſuffer the Euill of <hi>payne,</hi> or puniſhment, to the end we may not be forced to ſuffer the Euill of <hi>Fault,</hi> or ſinne. Such was the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Martyrs, who made choyce rather to vndergoe the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Perſecutours, then to yeald vnto an abnegation of their Fayth in Chriſt, and to ſuffer the loſſe of all their temporall goods, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But counterfaite and falſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is that, which perſuadeth a man to ſuffer all Euills and Inconueniences, thereby to giue ſatisfaction to the Law of Concupiſcence, and to looſe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Goods for the conſeruation of temporall and momentary. Such is the Patience of the Martyrs of the Deuill (ſo to ſtyle them) who eaſily endure hunger, thirſt, cold, heate, the loſſe of their reputation and good name, and (which is more to be admired) the loſſe of the Kingdome of Heauen, that

               <p>Now this is incident and peculiar to true Patience, to perfect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all Vertues. And this is that, which <hi>S.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14178:100"/> the Heauenly kingdome; Yet ſpoyle and depriue it of Patience, it becomes deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and endures not; take from it the vertue of ſuſtaining and tolerating, and then you do pull it quite vp by the roote.</hi> The which very point (I meane the neceſsity of Patience) the ſame S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> more eaſily proueth to be in Chaſtity, Iuſtice, and Peace with our neighbours, for thus he heerof diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth: <hi>Let thy Patience be strong &amp; immoueable in thy hart; let not thy ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed Body, and Temple of the Holy Ghoſt be polluted with adultery; neither let thy Innocency (deuoted to Iuſtice) be contaminated with any contagion of deceyt; nor after thou hast receaued the moſt reuerend Eucharist, let thy hand be diſhonoured with the ſword, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued in bloud. Ibid.</hi> Thus this Doctour; who intimateth from a contrary ſenſe, that Chaſtity without the ſupport of Patience, is not able to reſiſt <hi>Adultery,</hi> nor <hi>Iustice</hi> can be voide of fraud, nor the taking of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> can free a man from <hi>Homicide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, which <hi>S. Iames</hi> aboue tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, touching the vertue of Patience, is alſo taught in other words by the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> by Chriſt himſelfe, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14178:101"/> by the Apoſtle. <hi>Dauids</hi> wordes are theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. <hi>The patience of the poore ſhall neuer periſh.</hi> Beacuſe it is a perfect worke, and in this reſpect its reward ſhall not conſume or waſt away. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> alſo is ſaid not to periſh, becauſe it is recompenced for all eternity, in regard of its fruite: after this manner we are accuſtomed to ſay, that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of a Husbandman doe periſh, when they beare no fruite; and not periſh, when they beare fruite. Now the word, <hi>Poore,</hi> is heer added, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this place it ſignifyeth one, that is humble, who acknowledgeth himſelfe to be <hi>poore,</hi> and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eyther doe, or ſuffer any thing, without the concurrency and ayde of God; and thus is this point expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>S Auſtin lib. de patient. cap.</hi> 15. Neither only the poore, but the rich, and ſuch as do abound with affluency of temporall wealth, may haue the vertue of patience, ſo that they do not confide and truſt in their riches, but in God; of whome, as being truly poore in all diuine guifts, they pray for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and obtaine it.</p>
               <p>This ſaid point, our Lord himſelfe ſignifyed, when he ſayd in the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14178:101"/> 
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 21. <hi>In your patience, you ſhall poſſeſſe your ſoules.</hi> For he onely doth truly enioy his ſoule, that is his lyfe, of which no man can be bereaued, who will tollerate patiently all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yea the very death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo that he ſinneth not againſt God. For although by dying he may ſeeme to looſe lyfe, yet he looſeth it not, but keeps, and reſerues it for all Eternity. Since the death of the iuſt is not death, but a ſleep, and a very ſhort ſleep. But thoſe who are impatient, that ſo they looſe not the lyfe of the Body, feare not to ſinne, eyther by apoſtating and denying of Chriſt, worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, by becomming a prey to ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or by perpetrating any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whatſoeuer; theſe men ſeeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the time to preſerue lyfe, but they looſe eternall lyfe both of Body and ſoule. And as it is ſaid of thoſe who are truly patient: <hi>Not one hayre of your head ſhall periſh. Luc.</hi> 25. So to the impatient it may be ſaid; not one member of your Body ſhalbe free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the incendious heats, and burning of Hell.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this forſaid point the Apoſtle confirmeth, ſaying, <hi>Heb.</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:14178:102"/> 10, <hi>Patience is neceſſary for you, that doing the will of God, you may receaue the Promiſe.</hi> Where we ſee, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle plainly pronounceth, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is wholy neceſſary to vs, that thereby we may alwayes do the Will of God, and by doing it may receaue the Promiſe; that is, <hi>the Crowne of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which God hath promiſed for them that loue him, and keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Iac.</hi> 1. For we read, <hi>Yf any loue me, he will keep my Words; He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me not, keepeth not my Words. Ioan.</hi> 14. Thus vve obſerue the whole Scripture (cohering and agreing in it ſelfe) to preach to all the faithfull, the neceſsity of Patience. And this is the Cauſe, why Chriſt going out of this life, would teſtify to all men his inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, moſt bitter, and moſt long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>thirst,</hi> that we being moued with ſo great an Example, ſhould be inflamed to keep Patience in all our Afflictions. That this <hi>thirſt</hi> of Chriſt was a moſt vehement paine, we haue aboue ſhewed in the explication of the word, <hi>Sitio.</hi> That it continued for a long tyme, it may be eaſily made eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>And that we may begin from the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14178:102"/> ſcourging of Chriſt; when Chriſt was whipped, he was then already ſpent, and wearied through prolixity of Prayer, through his Agony &amp; effuſion of bloud in the garden; Alſo he was much tired with iourneys, which that night and the day following he made; As from the Garden to the Houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> from the houſe of <hi>Annas</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> from the houſe of <hi>Caiphas</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Pilate;</hi> from the houſe of <hi>Pilate</hi> to the houſe of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod;</hi> from the houſe of <hi>Herod</hi> backe againe to the houſe of <hi>Pilate;</hi> which ſeuerall iourneys contained many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Neither did our Lord (after his ſupper the night before) taſt of any meate or drinke, or tooke any repoſe and ſleepe; but endured many moſt grieuous afflictions in the houſe of <hi>Caiphas;</hi> and then immediatly after all theſe his preſſures, followed the moſt barbarous &amp; cruell whipping of him; the which was attended on with a moſt vehement <hi>Thirst,</hi> which <hi>Thirst</hi> much increaſed, when his whipping was ended. After all this ſucceeded his crowning with thornes, and the Iewes mocking him to ſcorne; which new vexation was alſo accompanied with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14178:103"/> extremity of <hi>thirſt,</hi> ſo as the ſame was very much increaſed. Then being euen waſted with ſo many iourne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, he was next burdened with the weight of his Croſſe which he bare vnto Mount <hi>Caluary:</hi> That iourney being ended, Wyne mingled with ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le was offered to him, the which when he began to taſt, he refuſed to drinke therof.</p>
               <p>Thus his iourneying to and fro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued an end; but the <hi>Thirst,</hi> which vexed our Lord throughout all his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle and labour, doubtleſly increaſed. For preſently his nayling to the Croſſe followed, and from hence one may eaſily conceaue, that his <hi>Thirst</hi> grew greater and more vehement through the defluxion &amp; ſtreaming of his moſt precious bloud, as from foure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. To conclude, during the ſpace of three houres following (to wit, from the ſixt hower to the ninth) in that horrible darknes, it can hardly be belieued, with what fyar or ardour of <hi>thirst</hi> that moſt ſacred body of our Lord was conſumed and waſted. And although it was Vinegre, which the Miniſters of his Paſsion offered to him; yet becauſe it was neither Wyne,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14178:103"/> nor Water, but Vinegre (that is, a ſharpe and vngratefull Potion) &amp; but ſmall in quantity, ſince he was to ſucke the ſame by drops out of a ſpunge, &amp; was moſt neere vnto his death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is lawfull to affirme, that our Bleſſed Redeemer euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Paſſion to his death, did ſuffer with wonderfull patience, this dolefull and moſt greuious torment. Now of what violence this torment is, few make tryall, ſince they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely find water, wherewith to quench their thirſt; but ſuch as trauell diuers dayes in deſert places (where ſmall or litle water is to be found) do fully take notice, how great a torment <hi>Thirst</hi> is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> writeth (<hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>de geſt. Alex.</hi>) that <hi>Alexander the great</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his Army through a long &amp; tedious deſart, his ſouldiers after much drought and thirſt came to a certaine Riuer, of which they dranke with ſuch guſt and greedmes, as that many of them by loſing their wynd, or breath in drinking, did preſently dye, &amp; then he thus concludeth: <hi>Multòque maior &amp;c The number of thoſe, by this meanes dying was far greater, then euer he loſt in any one battayle.</hi> Therefore the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14178:104"/> heate of the <hi>thirſt</hi> was ſo intollerable, as that the ſouldiers had not that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer themſelues, as in tyme of drinking, a litle to breath, or take their Wind. And thus the greateſt part of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army was extinct and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. There haue bene ſome men, who through extremity of <hi>thirſt,</hi> haue thought water mingled with dirt, oyle, bloud, and other more filthy things, to haue byn ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. From hence then, we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, how bitter the Paſſion of Chriſt was, and how great Vertue of his Patience appeared therein. And it was Gods will, that this his Patience ſhould be knowne to vs, that by our imitation of it, vve might ſo compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate &amp; ſuffer with Chriſt, as that vve may be glorified together vvith Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But it ſeemes to me, that I heare diuers good and pious ſoules, earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquiring, how they might arriue to that height, as ſeriouſly to imitate the Patience of Chriſt, and to ſay with the Apoſtle, I <hi>am faſtned to the Croſſe with Christ:</hi> &amp; with the holy <hi>Martyr</hi> S. <hi>Ignatius; Amor meus crucifixus est. My loue is crucifyed.</hi> This point is not ſo difficult, as many take it to be. For
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14178:104"/> it is not neceſſary for all men to lye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the cold ground; to diſcipline &amp; ſcourge their body with whips vntill the drawing of bloud; to faſt dayly with bread and water; to weare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually next to their skin a rough hayre cloath, or iron-chayne; or to practiſe other ſuch kinds of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the taming of the body, and crucifying It, with its vices and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences: theſe actions are laudable, and alſo profitable, when they are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by ſuch, whoſe bodies are able to beare them; and this by the aduice and direction of their ſpirituall Father or Inſtructour. But I in this place couet to ſhew to the pious Reader, a courſe or way of exerciſing Patience, and of imitating Chriſt, who was moſt patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; which courſe may agree to all men, &amp; in vvhich nothing is vnaccuſtomed; nothing taſting of nouelty, nothing, vvhich may ſeeme to gaine a vulgar praiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I ſay, that one vvho is zealous of Patience, ought vvillingly to be buſyed in thoſe labours vvhich he is aſſured are gratefull and pleaſing to the vvill of God, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>Patience is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:14178:105"/> for you, that you doing the VVill of God, may receaue the Promiſe.</hi> What God vvould haue vs patiently to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe, is not hard eyther to learne, or to teach. Firſt experience and dayly practiſe telleth vs, that vvhat things the Church (our Mother) commandeth to be done, the ſame (though hard and difficult) are to be performed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently and patiently. But vvhat doth the Church command vs? to vvit, the faſts of Lent, the Ember-dayes, and the vigill of Saints. If theſe be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſuch ſort, as they ought to be, they then cannot be performed vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Patience. For if a man vpon faſting dayes, vvill ſeeke after delicate and curious meates; and at one ſupper, or dinner eate as much meate, as at other tymes is vſuall to ſerue him both for dinner and ſupper; or els vvill preuent the houre of eating before noone, and then at night inſteed of a ſmall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Collation, will deuoure ſo much, as may wel to be termed a large and copious ſupper, certainly this Man will not eaſily ſuffer honger or thirſt; neyther will he ſtand in need of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But if he will conſtantly and ſeriouſly determine with himſelfe, not

And in faſting after this manner, we in ſome ſort may imitate the patience of Chriſt, &amp; his crucifixion. But theſe faſts are not wholy neceſſary, though they be neceſſary for the exerciſe of Patience, and for the imitation of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14178:106"/> Paſsion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Eccleſiaſticall, or Regular Perſons, to recite or ſing the <hi>ſeauen Canonicall Howers;</hi> and that all the faithfull at leaſt in prayer do read, &amp; recite the <hi>Lord Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angell.</hi> This religious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and prayer, if it be performed in that ſort, which it may, and ought to be, doubtleſly will ſtand in need of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But there are many, who that they may ſhake of all Patience, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to take away all difficulties. For they thinking, that a heauy burden is impoſed vpon them, do moſt ſwiftly run all things ouer, that ſo in a very ſhort ſpace, they may diſpatch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the Burden. Next to this, they do not ſtanding or kneeling, but either ſitting or walking, read the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Howers, to the end that the weariſomnes of reading or praying may be mitigated by ſitting or wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. I here ſpeake of ſuch, who read the howers in priuate, not of thoſe who ſing or ſay the ſame in the Quire. Furthermore, that they may not be forced to breake their ſleep, they vſe often to ſay their Mattins before the ſunne ſetteth.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:14178:106"/>
               <p>Touching the attention and eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind in tyme of prayer, and of prayſing God, I ſay little, ſince many thinke of nothing leſſe then of that, which they ſing, or reade. Therefore taking away the difficulty of ſpending much tyme in reading, or in Prayer, &amp; of riſing in the night to ſay their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, and omitting or neglecting the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ſtanding or kneeling; as alſo not regarding to put a bridle on the mind, that it may not wander in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and vnneceſſary thoughts, but that it may be wholy intent vpon that, vvhich it readeth: I ſay, that once taking avvay all theſe things, it is no wonder, if many do not ſeeme to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in need of Patience. But let ſuch negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent men heare and obſerue, with what ſollicitude and care <hi>S.

               <p>The <hi>Altar</hi> of this great Sacrifice was (as aboue I ſaid) the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> the vvhich by hovv much it was more vile
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14178:115"/> and baſe, before Chriſt vvas crucified thereon, by ſo much it was after made more illuſtrious, and more ennobled; and in the laſt day it ſhall appeare in Heauen more bright and ſhyning then the ſunne. For the Church interpreteth that of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> which is ſaid in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>Then ſhall the ſigne of the ſonne of man appeare in Heauen.</hi> In like ſort the Church thus ſingeth: <hi>This ſigne ſhalbe in Heauen, when our Lord ſhall come to iudge.</hi> The which point is alſo confirmed by <hi>S.

               <p>Furthermore the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſhalbe the <hi>Lambe of God,</hi> altogether innocent and immaculate, of whom <hi>Eſay</hi> thus ſpeaketh: <hi>cap.</hi> 55. <hi>Euen as a ſheepe to the ſlaughter ſhall he be led; and as a lambe before his ſhearer he ſhalbe dumbe, and ſhall not open his mouth.</hi> And the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner</hi> of our Lord ſayth: <hi>Behould the Lambe of God, behould who taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſinnes of the World.

The <hi>fyar</hi> burning the <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> and perfecting the Sacrifice, is Charity in a high degree, being as it were, a furnace ſet on fire, vvhich did burne in the hart of the Sonne of God, vvhich fire many waters of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vvere not able to extinguiſh. To conclude, the <hi>fruite of this Sacrifice</hi> vvas the expiation of all the ſinnes of the Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of the whole World. For thus <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſinnes; and not for ours only, but alſo for the whole World.</hi> Which very thing is ſignified by the words of <hi>S Iohn Baptiſt: Agnus Dei, Ecce, qui tollit peccata mundi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But heere ariſeth a doubt, vvhich is; Hovv could Chriſt be both Prieſt &amp; Sacrifice, ſince it is the function of the Prieſt to ſlaughter that, vvhich is to be ſacrifized? But Chriſt did not ſlay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, neither could he lawfully ſo doe;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:14178:116"/> ſince then he ſhould haue rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated ſacriledge, then offered vp Sacrifice. It is true, that Chriſt did not ſlay himſelfe; neuertheleſſe he truly offered vp ſacrifice, becauſe willingly and freely he offered himſelfe to be ſlaine for the glory of God, and expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne, For neither could the ſouldiers &amp; other Miniſters haue euer apprehended and taken him; neither could the nayles haue pierced his hands and feete; nor death could haue ſeized vpon him (though faſtened to the Croſſe) except himſelfe had bene willing thereto. Therefore <hi>Eſay</hi> moſt truly ſayrh: <hi>He was offered, becauſe himſelfe would.</hi> And our Lord himſelfe ſayth. <hi>Io.</hi> 10. <hi>I yield my lyfe; no man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it away from me, but</hi> I <hi>yield my ſelfe.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>S.

               <p>Now what euill or ſinne, or rather atrocity vvas in the Paſsion of Chriſt, all that belonged to <hi>Iudas,</hi> the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the ſouldiers; for theſe men did not offer vp Sacrifice, but did commit muſt horrible ſacriledge, deſeruing the name not of Prieſts, but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14178:117"/> of ſacrilegious Perſons. But vvhat in the ſame Paſsion was good, religious, and pious, ſtreamed from Chriſt; who out of the affluency and abundance of his Charity, offered himſelfe as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, not in ſlaying himſelfe, but in tollerating moſt patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly death; to wit, the death of the Croſſe; and this to the end he might appeaſe the wrath of God, reconcile the vvorld to God, ſatisfy the diuine Iuſtice, that ſo mankind ſhould not periſh.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14178:118"/> becauſe our Lord had moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondantly ſatisfyed the diuine Iuſtice vpon the Croſſe, for the offence of the <hi>firſt Man,</hi> and of all the faithfull. For the Obedience exhibited to God, by the Sonne, was greater then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of the ſeruant to his Lord; And the Sonne of God was more hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, euen to death, for the honour of his Father then the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp in pryde, through his iniury of God.

               <p>There is another reaſon, which S. <hi>Leo</hi> is accuſtomed to bring, which I will relate in his owne words: <hi>Si c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Serm</hi> 10. <hi>de paſſ.</hi> Certainly a moſt forcible reaſon. For it was reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14178:118"/> that the diuell ſhould looſe his empire or command ouer all thoſe whome he had conquered vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But if the matter ſtand thus: If the warre be <hi>conſummate</hi> and ended, if the victory be in the power of the Son of God, and he willeth, <hi>That all men may be ſaued.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. how then commeth it to paſſe that ſo many men do remaine euen to this day ſlaues to the diuell in this lyfe, and in the next lyfe are ſent to the torment of Hell?

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14178:119"/> the Church exulting ſingeth: <hi>The ſting of death being ouercome, thou didst open the Kingdome of Heauen to belieuers.</hi> The other benefit; that he did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the holy Sacramnts, which ſhould haue power of remitting ſinne, and confirming grace, and did ſend forth publiſhers thereof into all parts of the world, who with loud voice did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame &amp; preach, <hi>He that ſhall belieue, and be baptized, ſhalbe ſaued.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord being victour in this Watre, did open the way to all men for the enioying the liberty of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, belonging to the Sonnes of God. Now if any forbeare to enter into this way, they periſh through their owne default; not through the impotency, weaknes, or negligence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly to conclude, the Word, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatum eſt,</hi> may rightly be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the <hi>conſummation</hi> of the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which is the Church. That the <hi>Perfection</hi> of a building, may be called the <hi>conſummation of it,</hi> Chriſt himſelfe out Maiſter, doth warrant, ſaying? <hi>This man began to build, but he could not conſummate or finiſh it. Luc.</hi> 14. Now <hi>S. Epiphanius, S. Austin</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14178:119"/> holy Fathers do teach, that, that Church was conſummate and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Paſſion of Chriſt, which was begun in his Baptiſme. They fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach, that <hi>Eue</hi> being built or made of the ribbe of <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping, was a figure of the Church, which is built out of the ſide of Chriſt, whiles he began to ſleep by death. And they alſo note, that the Scripture ſayd not without ſome myſtery, that <hi>Eua</hi> was <hi>edificata, non formata,</hi> built, not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>Now that the Church did beginne to be built from the Baptiſme of Chriſt <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> proueth, expounding that place of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. <hi>He ſhall rule from ſea to ſea, and from the Riuers, euen to the ends of the VVorld.</hi> For the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt in which is his Church began from the Baptiſme of Chriſt; in which he receauing the Baptiſme of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> did conſecrate the water, and did inſtitute his Baptiſme, which is the Gate of the Church. Which point ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appeared from the voyce of the Father, heard from Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whome I am well pleaſed; heare him.</hi> And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time, our Lord began to preach,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14178:120"/> and to aſſemble diſciples togeather, who were the firſt that came vnto the Church. For although the opening of the ſide of Chriſt was made after his death; and then bloud and water came from thence, which ſignified two chiefe Sacraments of the Church, to wit. <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and <hi>Eucharist;</hi> Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles all the Sacraments receaue their vertue from the Paſſion of Chriſt, and the flowing of bloud and water from the ſide of Chriſt being then dead was a declaration of the myſteries, not an inſtitution. Therefore moſt truly the <hi>conſummation</hi> of the edifice of the Church was then ſaid to be, when Chriſt ſpeake this Word, <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est, It is conſummate:</hi> becauſe then nothing was remayning to be effected, but his death, which inſtantly did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and which did <hi>conſummate</hi> and perfect the price of our Redemption.</p>

For the Prophets did ſpeake not out of humane Witt, but from the Holy Ghoſt inſpiring them: and ſince the Holy Ghoſt is God, and that it is impoſſible, that God ſhould eyther be deceaued, or lye; therefore it demonſtratiuely followeth, that all

But we knowing that to haue beene already fullfilled, which the Prophet <hi>Noë</hi> did foretell, why may we not with facility belieue, that a deluge of of fyre ſhall heerafter come, in which all thoſe things ſhal be deſtroyed, which we now eſteeme and prize at ſo high a rate? And yet neuertheleſſe there are very few, who ſo belieue theſe things to be, as to withdraw their deſire from ſuch matters, as are heerafter to periſh, and to fix their minds, where there are true and euerlaſting Ioyes.</p>
               <p>But this very Point is propheſied of our Lord himſelfe, that ſuch men may reſt inexcuſable, who from the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of things paſt, can not be drawne to belieue that thinges future ſhalbe fulfilled.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14178:125"/> vs in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> moſt accurately, to offer a myſticall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, euen from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Bodies: for there were foure lawes or neceſſary conditions of Sacrifices. The firſt, that an Hoaſt be preſent in the ſacrifice, that is, a thing dedicated to God, the which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to conuert to any prophane vſe. Another was, that it ſhould be a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thing, as a ſheep, a Goate, a Calfe. The third, that it ſhould be holy, that is, cleane: for among the Hebrews ſome were accounted cleane Creatures, others vncleane. The cleane liuing Creatures were ſheep, Oxen, Goates, Turtles, ſparrowes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues; and the reſt were taken as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and vncleane, as Horſes, Lions, Foxes, Birds liuing by pray, Crowes, and the like. The fourth, that the Hoaſt ſhould be enkindled and ſet on fire, that ſo it might ſend forth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of ſweetnes. And all theſe the Apoſtle doth reckon, when he ſaith: <hi>I beſeech you exhibit your bodies, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Hoast, holy, pleaſing God,</hi> &amp; then addeth, <hi>your reaſonable ſeruice;</hi> to the end we may vnderſtand him, not to counſell vs to a ſacrifice properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14178:126"/> as if he did meane, that our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (like vnto ſheep ſacrificed) ſhould be truly ſlaine, and burned; but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort vs to a myſticall ſacrifice and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall; to a ſacrifice only by reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, not proper; ſpirituall, not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. Therefore the Apoſtle, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeth vs, that as Chriſt for our health, did offer vp the Sacrifice of his owne Body vpon the Croſſe, by a true and reall death; ſo ought we to offer vp our Bodies to his honour, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Hoaſt, liuing, holy, and perfect, and therin pleaſing to God; the which Hoaſt after a certaine ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may be ſaid to be ſlaine, &amp; burned.</p>
               <p>Let vs explicate in order the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conditions. Firſt our Bodies ought to be Hoaſts, that is, things conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God; the which, not as our own but as the things of God, we are to vſe to the glory of God; to whome we are conſecrated by Baptiſme; and vvho bought vs vvith a great price, as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought vve to be an Hoaſt of God; but vvithall a liuing Hoaſt through the lyfe of grace, and the Holy Ghoſt. For thoſe men, vvho are dead through ſinne, are not the Hoaſts of God,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14178:126"/> but of the Deuill, who mortifieth their ſoules, and much glorieth therein. But our God, who euer liueth, and is the fountaine of life, will not haue ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Carcaſſes to be offered to him, which are profitable for nothing, but to be caſt out to the Beaſts: Therefore it is neceſſary, that we conſerue the life of the ſoule with all diligence, that by this meanes we may exhibit to our Lord our <hi>Reaſonable Seruice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it required only, that the Hoaſt be liuing, but alſo it muſt be <hi>holy,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayth: <hi>liuing, &amp; holy.</hi> The Hoaſt is ſaid to be holy, when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered of <hi>cleane</hi> liuing Creatures, not of <hi>vncleane.</hi> Now the cleane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are foure footed, as aboue we ſaid, were <hi>ſheepe, Goates, Oxen;</hi> of Birds, <hi>Turtles, ſparrowes, Doues.</hi> The firſt ſort of theſe liuing Creatures do figure out an Actiue life; the ſecond a Contemplatiue. Therefore thoſe men, who do lead an Actiue life among the faythfull, if ſo they will exhibit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a holy ſacrifice or Hoaſt to God, they ought to imitate the ſimplicity and gentlenes of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> which is ignorant how to hurt its, fellow. In like ſort they are to imitate the labours &amp;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14178:127"/> paines of the <hi>Oxe,</hi> which is not idle, nor wandreth here and there; but bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his yoake, and drawing after him the plow, laboreth continually in til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ground.

               <p>Neither thoſe men, who lead an Actiue life in the Church of God, ought to content themſelues with meeknes, and iuſt labours; but it behoueth them alſo by their often iterated and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied prayers, to aſcend high, and to fixe their eyes vpon thoſe things, which be aboue. For how ſhall they refer their works to the glory of God, and ſend vp the incenſe of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, if ſeldome or neuer they thinke on God? If through Contemplation they do not burne in loue towards him?

For there is nothing, which doth mortify a mans Carnall Concupiſcence more efficaciouſly, ſpeedily, &amp; perfectly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſincere Loue of God: for it is the King and Lord of all the Affections of the Hart; and all of them are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and depend of it, whether it be Feare, Hope, Deſire, Hate, Anger or any other perturbation of the mind.

Thereupon fiery deſites and moſt pure Prayers do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp to God, like to aromaticall wood in an odour of ſweetnes. This then is that Sacrifice, the vvhich God requireth from vs, and the which moſt promptly and diligently to performe the Apoſtle exhorteth vs.</p>

               <p>THe laſt fruite remayning, is to be gathered from the Example of the Perſeuerance of our Lord vpon the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> ſince from that word, <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum est,</hi> we gather, that our Lord had conſummated and finiſhed the whole Worke of his Paſſion, euen from the beginning to the End; ſo as nothing more thereto could be deſired or wiſhed. <hi>The works of God</hi> (ſayth <hi>Moyſes) are perfect, Deut.</hi> 32. And euen as the Father did perfect in the ſixt day the vvorke of mans Creation, and vpon the ſeauenth did reſt; So the Sonne in the ſixt day did <hi>conſummate</hi> the worke of mans Redemption, and vpon the ſeauenth did alſo reſt. In vayne did the Iewes cry out before the <hi>Croſſe, If he be the king of Iſraell, let him now come downe from the Croſſe.</hi> But <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ſayth more aptly <hi>Serm.</hi> 1. <hi>de Reſurrect. Immò, quia Rex Iſrael eſt, &amp;c. Yea becauſe he is the King of Iſrael,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14178:134"/> let him not looſe the title of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And a litle after: <hi>Non tibi dabit occaſionem &amp;c. Chriſt will not giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of depriuing thee of perſeuerance, which alone is crowned. He will not cauſe the tongues to be ſilent of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, perſwading and comforting the faint harted and weake, and ſaying to euery of them: Looke thou doest not forſake thy Place or Station; the which doubtleſly would follow, if they might reply, Chriſt hath forſaken his Place.</hi> Chriſt therefore perſeuered vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> till che end of his life, that he might ſo <hi>conſummate,</hi> and perfect his owne Worke, as that nothing ſhould be wanting thereto, and that he might leaue after him a moſt admirable Example of Perſeuerance.</p>
               <p>Truly it is an eaſy matter to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and continue in ſweet places, and in doing pleaſing Actions; but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if we did know, what induced Chriſt to perſeuer vpon the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our ſelfes would learne to beare our <hi>Croſſe</hi> perſeuerantly; yea if it were lawfull to hang vpon it euen vntill death. If a man do caſt his eyes only
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14178:134"/> vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> the Inſtrument of ſo lamentable a death (being but ſeene) it cannot but beget an horrour in his hart. But if he looke vp with the eyes, not ſo much of his body, as of his ſoule, towards him who commandeth vs to beare the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and towards the place, whither the <hi>Croſſe</hi> leadeth, and to the fruit or benefit, which the ſaid <hi>Croſſe</hi> produceth; then it is not a thing hard or vngratefull, but eaſy &amp; pleaſant to perſeuer in kiſsing of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and perſeuerantly to hang v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What therefore moued Chriſt ſo inceſſantly, without complaining, to hang vpon the Croſſe euen vntill death? The firſt cauſe heerof was che loue towards his Father: <hi>The cup, which my Father hath giuen me</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>wilt not thou, that I do drinke it? Ioan.</hi> 18. Chriſt did loue his Father with an ineffable loue; and with the lyke loue was beloued of him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſt did ſee that cup to be prepared for him, by his moſt good &amp; louing Father, he could not in any ſort ſuſpect, but that it was giuen to him for a moſt happy end, and to him moſt glorious. Was it then any ſtrange
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14178:135"/> thing if he did drinke vp all the cup moſt willingly?

To conclude, Chriſt did not reſpect only the loue of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of his Spouſe, when he was ready to drinke the cup of his Paſſion; but alſo he had a regard to that moſt eminent glory, and greatnes of Ioy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be ended, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>We may adioyne to the Example of Chriſt the Example of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> reckoning the Croſſes of himſelfe, and of the other Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, thus conteſteth: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Who then ſhall ſeparate vs from the Charity of Chriſt?

Therefore the Contemplation of eternall glory, which he did place before the eyes of his mynd, was the cauſe, why tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did appeare to him to be but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and light. <hi>Has cogitationes &amp;c.</hi> (ſayth <hi>S.

               <p>Now from theſe examples of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, all Chriſtians may learne, how they ought to beare themſelues, when they cannot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from their <hi>Croſſe;</hi> that is, when they cannot be freed of their Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without ſinne. In the number of theſe are firſt Regular Perſons, whoſe life being tyed to the vowes of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, Chaſtity,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like vnto Martyrdome. In like ſort married Perſons, when through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Prouidence the husband hath gotten a harſh, cholerick, vnquiet (and almoſt intollerable) wyfe: or the wyfe hath a husband of a fierce, &amp; rough diſpoſition; and ſuch was the husband of <hi>S.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14178:137"/> to perpetuall priſon, or to the Gallyes. In like ſort, ſicke Perſons who labour with ſome incurable diſeaſe. And poore men, vvho cannot aſpire to riches but by ſtealth and thieuery. All theſe (and ſuch others in like caſe) if they deſire to ſuffer their <hi>Croſſe,</hi> with ſpirituall ioy, and great reward, let them not looke vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> but vpon him who hath layed the <hi>Croſse</hi> vpon their ſhoulders. But he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly was God, who is our moſt louing Father, and without whoſe Prouidence nothing in this world is done. Now the pleaſure and will of God is beſt, &amp; ought to be moſt gratefull vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, all men ought to ſay with Chriſt; <hi>The Cup which my Father hath giuen me, will thou not, that</hi> I <hi>ſhould drinke?</hi> And with the Apoſtle: <hi>In all thoſe things we ouercome for his ſake, who loued vs.</hi> Moreouer all men ought, and may conſider who cannot depoſe and lay aſide their <hi>Croſse</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, not ſo much the preſent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as the future reward, which doubtleſly doth ſurmount all labour and griefe of this preſent life, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaying: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The ſufferings of this time are not condigne to the glory to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14178:137"/> come, that ſhalbe reuealed in vs.</hi> Who ſpeaking of <hi>Moyſes</hi> in an other place, thus writeth: <hi>Moyſes eſteemed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt greater riches, then the treaſure of the Egyptians; for he looked into the remuneration. Hebr.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we may produce for the comfort of thoſe men who are conſtrained to vndergoe a heauy <hi>Croſse</hi> for a long tyme, the example of two men, who did loſe their perſeuerance, and thereupon did fynd incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a farre greater <hi>Croſse. Iudas</hi> the Betrayer of Chriſt, when he reflected vpon himſelfe, did deteſt his ſinne of Treachery, and not enduring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and ſhame which he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, if he would conuerſe with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Diſciples, did hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. So as he changed only, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded not the <hi>Croſse</hi> of the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he did flie; Since greater Confuſion ſhall follow him at the day of iudgment, in the preſence &amp; ſight of all the Angels, and of men, when he ſhalbe declared to be not only the Betrayer of Chriſt, but withall his owne Homicide or Butcher. And how great blindnes then was it in him, to auoyde a ſmall confuſion among a few
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:14178:138"/> perſons; who being the Diſciples of Chriſt, were mild and gentle, &amp; who euer would haue beene ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him to hope well of the Mercy of the Sauiour of the world; but not to auoyde the infamy and confuſion of his betraying of Chriſt, &amp; hanging himſelfe in the Theater and eye of all men and Angels?</p>

Of the whole number of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers thirty and nyne, ſetting before their eyes not ſo much the preſent puniſhment of being frozen to death (which would in a ſhort tyme be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:14178:138"/> ended) as the Eternity of glory and happines, perſeuered in their Fayth, &amp; receaued from the hands and bounty of our Lord, moſt glorious Crownes, Our ſouldier, who had his mind fixed only vpon the preſent torment, could not perſeuere in his Chriſtian fayth, did thereupon leape into the warme Bath. But he had no ſooner gotten thereinto, but that ſeuerall parts of his fleſh being already congealed, did fall aſunder and the poore wretch breathed out his Soule, and as denier of Chriſt, deſcended into Hell and to perpetuall torments. Thus he flying death, he found death, and changed a ſhort and light <hi>Croſse</hi> or tribulation, for an euerlaſting and moſt grieuous <hi>Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all thoſe do imitate theſe two moſt vnhappy men who do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the <hi>Croſse</hi> of a religious Courſe of life; who do caſt off a ſweet yoake and eaſy burden; and when they leaſt thinke therof, they do find themſelfes to be tyed to a farre more grieuous yoake of diuers Concupiſcences and Paſſions, which they can neuer ſatisfy; and thus being preſſed downe with the moſt heauy weight of their ſinnes,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14178:139"/> they are not able to breath, or take wynd. The like reaſon is of all thoſe, who refuſe to beare their <hi>Croſse</hi> with Chriſt, and yet through ſinning are forced to beare a far more grieuous <hi>Croſse</hi> with the Deuill.</p>

                  <hi>Spiritum meum,</hi> Touching this word, how it is here to be taken, there is no ſmall Controuerſy. The word, <hi>Spiritus,</hi> is accuſtomed to be taken for the <hi>Soule,</hi> vvhich is the ſubſtantiall forme of the Body, as alſo it is taken for life it ſelfe: and the reaſon hereof is, becauſe breathing is a ſigne of lyfe; and who do breath, do liue; and who ceaſe to breath, do dye. And certainly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14178:140"/> if by the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> vve vnderſtand in this place the <hi>Soule</hi> of Chriſt, we are to take heed, that no man ſhould imagine there were any danger for that ſoule to goe out of its body: As when other men are in dying, their ſoule is accuſtomed to be commended to God, through many Prayers, and great Care, in that it goeth to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of the Iudge, ready to receaue for its good, or wicked works, Glory, or Puniſhment. Such a Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, the ſoule of Chriſt did not need; both in that it was bleſſed from the beginning of its Creation; as alſo becauſe it was ioyned in <hi>Perſon</hi> with the Sonne of God, and might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the <hi>Soule of God:</hi> and laſtly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as victorious and triumphing, it went out of its Body, and was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to all the Deuills, but they could be no terrour to it. Therefore if the <hi>Spirit</hi> be taken in this place for the <hi>Soule,</hi> then theſe words of our Lord, <hi>Commendo ſpiritum meum,</hi> do ſignify, that the Soule of Chriſt, which vvas in its Body, as in a Tabernacle, was to be in the hands of the Father, as <hi>in depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito,</hi> vntill it did returne to the Body; according to that, <hi>Sap.</hi> 3. <hi>The ſoules of

               </p>
               <p>But it is much more credible, that by the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> in this place <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life</hi> is vnderſtood, ſo as the ſenſe is to be this: I do now deliuer vp the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of my life, and therein I ceaſe to breath and to liue: But this <hi>ſpirit,</hi> this life <hi>(O Father)</hi> I commend to thee, that vvithin a ſhort tyme thou mayſt reſtore it to my Body: For to thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is loſt, but all things do liue to thee; who in calling out that vvhich is not, makeſt it be; and in calling out that, which doth not liue, makeſt it to liue. That this is the true meaning of this place, may firſt be gathered out of the 30. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> from whence our Lord did take this Prayer. For thus <hi>Dauid</hi> doth there pray: <hi>Thou wilt bring me out of this ſnare which they haue hid for me, becauſe thou art my Protectour; Into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi> In vvhich place the Prophet by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> moſt euidently vnderſtandeth <hi>lyfe;</hi> for he prayeth to God, that he will not ſuffer him to be ſlayne by his Enemies but that he will preſerue his lyfe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the ſame point is deduced as true, euen from this place of the Goſpell. For after our Lord had ſaid;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:14178:141"/> 
                  <hi>Father into thy hands I do commend my ſpirit,</hi> the Euangeliſt did ſubioyne: <hi>And ſaying this, he gaue vp the Ghoſt;</hi> For <hi>to giue vp the Ghost</hi> ſignifieth to ceaſe to draw ſpirit or wynd, which is proper to thoſe Creatures which are liuing; the vvhich thing cannot be ſaid of the ſoule, the ſubſtantiall forme of the Body; but it is ſaid of the ayre which vve <hi>breath,</hi> vvhilſt we liue; and we do ceaſe to <hi>breath,</hi> vvhen we dye.</p>

                  </gap>y the foreſaid expoſition is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from thoſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. <hi>Who in the dayes of his flesh, with a strong cry and teares, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring prayers and ſupplications to him, that could ſaue him from death, was heard for his reuerence.</hi> This place ſome do vnderſtand of the prayer, which our Lord made in the garden, ſaying: <hi>Father, if it be poſsible, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this Chalice from me. Mar.</hi> 14. But in that place our Lord did not pray with a ſtrong cry, neither was he heard, neither would he haue beene heard, that he ſhould be free &amp; exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from the death. For he prayed that the Chalice of his Paſsion might paſſe from him, thereby to ſhew a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall deſire of not dying, and himſelfe
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:14178:141"/> to be true man, whoſe nature doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre death: But he added; <hi>Not that which</hi> I <hi>will, but that which thou let thy Will be done.</hi> Thus we ſee, that the prayer of Chriſt in the garden cannot be that Prayer, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the Hebrews.</p>
               <p>Others maintaine, that that prayer of Chriſt mentioned by <hi>S.

For being vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> he prayed for his Crucifiers, that that moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and heauy ſinne might be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them. Therefore it remaineth, that thoſe words of the Apoſtle be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode of that laſt prayer, which our Lord made vpon the Croſſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit;</hi> the which prayer he made with a ſtrong crye, <hi>S.

Chriſt did not teach vs this by his example, ſince he commended his ſoule not to his kinsmen, but to his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14178:149"/> Father. Neyther doth <hi>S. Peter</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs, that we ſhould commend our ſoules to our Children, or kinsfolkes, <hi>but to the faythfull Creatour, by good deedes</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</p>

But when
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14178:150"/> theſe come to the diuine ballacing &amp; examination, and are preciſely to be diſcuſſed, whether they were well done; to wit, with right intentions, with due attention, in fitting tyme and place, proceeding from a man grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God; O how many things, which did appeare to be gaines to the ſoule, will rather be accounted, as loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and detriments vnto it!

For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did moſt truly write, that our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt was heard, <hi>for his
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14178:151"/> reuerence Heb.</hi> 5. Our Lord prayed to his Father for a ſpeedy Reſurrection of his Body, as aboue we haue ſhewed. His prayer was heard, ſo as his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was no longer delayed, then it was needfull to proue, that his Body was truly dead. For except it could be infallibly demonſtrated, that his Body did truly depart out of this lyfe, both the Reſurrection, as alſo the whole Chriſtian Fayth might be doubted of, and called into queſtion. Therefore our Sauiour was to remaine in the graue for the ſpace at leaſt of fourty houres; eſpecially ſeeing the figure of <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet was to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which (as our Lord himſelfe taught in the Ghoſpell) was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate and foreſhew his death.</p>
               <p>But to the end, that the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt might be accelerated &amp; haſtened ſo farre forth, as it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient; and that it might be more manifeſtly proued, that the prayer of Chriſt was heard, the diuine Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would, that the three dayes and three nights, during which tyme <hi>Ionas</hi> was in the Belly of the Whale, ſhould be reduced in the Reſurrection of Chriſt, to one entire and whole day, and two
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14178:151"/> parts of two dayes; which time not properly (but by the figure <hi>intellectio</hi>) might be ſaid to contayne three dayes &amp; three nights. Neither did the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare the prayer of Chriſt only in ſhortning the tyme of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but alſo in reſtoring incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably a better lyfe, then before he enioyed. Since the lyfe of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, was mortall; but it is reſtored to him immortall: <hi>Christ ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againe from the dead, now dieth no more; death ſhall no more haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer him,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. The lyfe of Chriſt before his death, was paſſible, that is, ſubiect to hunger, thirſt, wearines, wounds; but being reſtored impaſsible, it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds not obnoxious to any iniury. The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt was before death <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male;</hi> but after the reſurrection it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>ſpiritale;</hi> that is, ſo ſubiect to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as that in a twinkling of an Eye; it might be caryed into any place, where the ſpirit it ſelfe would.</p>
               <p>Novv the reaſon, why the Prayer of Chriſt was ſo eaſily heard, is ſubioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apoſtle, when he ſayth, <hi>pro ſua reuerentia,</hi> for his reuerence. The Greeke word here vſed, (to

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) ſignifieth <hi>a reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall feare,</hi> vvhich was moſt eminent in Chriſt tovvards his father. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eſay</hi> deſcribing the guifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which were in the ſoule of Chriſt, of other guifts thus ſayth: <hi>The ſpirit of wiſdome and Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhall reſt vpon him: the ſpirit of Counſell and Strength: the ſpirit of Knowledge and Piety;</hi> but of <hi>reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Feare,</hi> the ſaid Prophet thus ſpeaketh: <hi>And the ſpirit of the Feare of our Lord ſhall repleniſh him. Iſa.</hi> 11. Novv becauſe the ſoule of Chriſt was moſt full of <hi>reuerentiall Feare</hi> towards his Father, therefore the Father did take moſt great pleaſure in him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that we read in <hi>S. Matthew: This is my beloued ſonne, in whom</hi> I <hi>am well pleaſed. Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. And euen as the Sonne did euer reuerence the Father in a moſt high degree, ſo did the Father euer heare him praying, and granted whatſoeuer he deſired.</p>
               <p>Novv from hence may we learne, that, if vve expect euer to be heard by our heauenly Father, and to obtaine whatſoeuer we demaund of him, we ought to imitate Chriſt herin, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting our ſaid heauenly Father with
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14178:152"/> ſupreme Reuerence, and in preferring nothing before his honour. For ſo it wilbe effected, that whatſoeuer we pray for, we ſhall obtaine, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, that, in which conſiſteth the chiefeſt good of our ſtate; I meane, that vvhen death ſhall approach, God may receaue our ſoule paſſing out of the Body, commended vnto him, vvhen the roaring Lyon ſtandeth neere vnto vs, as being ready for a prey. Neither let any man thinke, that <hi>Reuerence</hi> is exhibited to God only in genufle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or in bovving of the knee, in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering of the Head, or in any other worſhip and honour of ſuch like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:14178:153"/> God (and in that reſpect may be called <hi>Bleſſed</hi>) who with all bent of Will and Endeauour, ſtudies to keep all the Commandement of God.

               <p>The ſacred Scripture doth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commend the ſame thing in Holy <hi>Iob.</hi> For he made a couenant with his eyes, that he would not ſo much as thinke of a Virgin, that is, he vvould not look vpon a Virgin, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent therby that no vnchaſt thought

               <p>Firſt, the Obedience of Chriſt tooke its beginning from his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and continued without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion euen to his death, Thus the whole life of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was but one Act, or Courſe of a continuated, and vnintterrupted Obedience. Truly the ſoule of Chriſt euen in the firſt moment of its Creation, had the vſe of freewill, and withall was repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Grace and Wiſdome; and therefore euen from that firſt mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Chriſt being as yet incloſed in the wombe of his mother, began to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Obedience. Where we read in the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14178:154"/> 39. Pſalme, in which it is ſaid in the Perſon of Chriſt: <hi>In the head of the booke it is written of me, that I ſhould do thy will: my God, I would, and thy law in the middest of my Hart.</hi> That, <hi>in the head of the booke,</hi> ſignifieth no other thing, but in the ſumme of the diuine Scripture that is, throughout the whole Scripture, it is chiefly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of me, that I am peculiarly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and ſent to this end, that I ſhould do thy Will. I, my God, will, &amp; I haue moſt willingly accepted thereof, and <hi>thy law,</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is thy commandement I haue placed in <hi>the middeſt of my hart,</hi> that I might euer thinke thereof, and might moſt diligently performe and execute it.</p>
               <p>And hither alſo thoſe words of our ſaid Lord haue reference: <hi>My meate is to do tho will of him that ſent me, to perfect his worke. Ioan.</hi> 4. For as meate is not taken once or twice through a mans life, but is taken daily &amp; with pleaſure: ſo our Lord himſelf did continually, and with a willing mind practice all Obedience to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And hereupon he ſaid: I <hi>deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Heauen, not to doe my owne will, but the will of him, that ſent me.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14178:155"/> Ioan.</hi> 6. And more clearely in another place: <hi>He that ſent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone, becauſe the things that pleaſe him,</hi> I <hi>do alwayes. Ioan.</hi> 8. And becauſe Obedience is the moſt excellent Sacrifice of all Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to the iudgment of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel;</hi> therefore it followeth, that how many works Chriſt did all the tyme, that he liued as Pilgrime vpon the Earth, ſo many Sacrifices did he offer vp, and thoſe moſt gratefull to God. This therefore is the firſt Prerogat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ue of the Obedience of Chriſt; to wit, in that it endured from his Conception, to the end of his life.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the Obedience of Chriſt was not determinable to any one kind of worke, as we commonly ſee it is among men; but it was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all thoſe things, vvhich it ſhould pleaſe God his Father to command him. And from hence ſo great variety is ſeene in the life of Chriſt our Lord, as that one vvhile he would ſtay in the deſert, neither eating nor drinking, &amp; perhaps not ſleeping, but liuing with beaſts, as S. <hi>Marke</hi> not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:14178:155"/> Then, he remained obſcure and ſecret at home, and that for no few yeares. At an other tyme appearing excellent for wiſdome and Eloquence, working moſt great and ſtupendious Miracles: Novv, with great authority caſting buyers and ſellers out of the Temple; At an other tyme latent, &amp; (as it were) weake, declining from the multitude and company of men; All which things require and exact a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd free from all proper free will. For neither would our Lord haue ſaid: <hi>Math.</hi> 16. <hi>He that will come after me, let him deny himſelfe;</hi> that is, let him renounce his proper will, and proper iudgment: Neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Chriſt himſelfe had performed it before, he would haue perſuaded his diſciples to the perfection of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when he ſaid: <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. <hi>If any man commeth to me, and hateth not hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:14178:156"/>
               <p>This is the true roote and Mother of Obedience, vvhich ſhyned moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably in Chriſt our Lord. And who want this, ſhall hardly euer come to the revvard of Obedience. For how is it poſſible that one ſhould promptly obey an other mans Will, who is wholy deuoted to his ovvne will, and his owne iudgment? This is the Cauſe why the Celeſtiall Orbes do not reſiſt or withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Angels mouing them, vvhether they be caried towards the Eaſt, or Weſt; becauſe they haue not any peculiar and proper propenſion either to one part, or to the other. And the ſame reaſon is, why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelfes ſtand at a becke obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto God, as holy <hi>Dauid</hi> ſingeth in the 102. Pſalme. To wit, becauſe they haue no proper Will, repugnant and refractary to the will of God; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt happely conioyned vvith God, they are one ſpirit vvith him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Obedience of Chriſt is not only largely on ech ſyde diffuſed; but withall by how much it is depreſſed downe by Patience and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, by ſo much, through the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of its merits, it is eleuated and aduanced on high. Therefore the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14178:156"/> third Propriety of the Obedience of Chriſt is, that it deſcendeth to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Patience and Humility. Chriſt being an Infant, to fulfill the Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his Father, began (though full of knowledge and prudence) to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite in a darke priſon. Other Infants, who want Reaſon in their mothers Wombe, ſuffer no griefe or moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But Chriſt enioying in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe the vſe of Reaſon, would haue had no doubt a horrour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in that ſtraite Priſon nyne Months, had not the obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Father and loue to mankind cauſed him for the ſetting vs at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as the Church ſingeth) <hi>that he did not abhor the wombe of the Virgin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed, no ſmall Patience &amp; Humility was neceſſary, that Chriſt during all the time of his Infancy (who then was more wiſe then <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſince in him <hi>were all the treaſures of VViſdome and Knowledge</hi>) ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate and apply himſelfe to the manners &amp; weakenes of Infants: But tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:14178:157"/> theſe his humble Obedience did take ſuch deepe roote, as that it may plainly ſeeme to be in-imitable. But yet there remaineth a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity and depth of his Obedience, which concerned the laſt of all terrible things; &amp; to this <hi>Abyſmall</hi> profundity the Obedience of Chriſt deſcended, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crying with a loud voyce, he ſaid: <hi>Father into thy hands</hi> I <hi>commend my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and ſaying this, he gaue vp the Ghost. Luc.</hi> 23. The Sonne of God may be thought and ſuppoſed to ſpeake to his Father in this ſort. <hi>O Father</hi> I haue receaued commandement from you, that I ſhould lay downe my lyfe, and after receaue it, now the tyme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that I accompliſh this your laſt command. And although the diſiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my ſoule from my fleſh (both which euen from the beginning of their vnion to this houre haue remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in great peace and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) be moſt bitter; and alſo although death, introduced through the Enuy of the diuell, be very aduerſe to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and the laſt of all terrible thinges; notwithſtanding your commandment being moſt deeply into the middſt of my hart, doth ouerballance all other
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:14178:158"/> things. Therefore I now ſtand prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euen to ſwallow downe death, and to exhauſt &amp; drinke vp this moſt bitter chalice giuen to me by you. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your commandement was, that I ſhould after reſume &amp; take it againe; therefore into your hands I commend my ſpirit, that you may reſtore it to me in the next conueniency of tyme.

               <p>Furthermore, how great againe is it, to merit in euery worke in the ſight of God?

               <p>
                  <hi>S. Gregory</hi> notably ſheweth the difference betvvene true and forged Obedience, vvho thus ſpeaketh, <hi>l.</hi> 35. <hi>mor. c.</hi> 10. <hi>Quia nonnunquam nobis &amp;c. Becauſe ſometymes things pleaſing to this world, at other tymes things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing are commanded to be done; therefore we are chiefly to knowe, that ſometimes Obedience, if it haue nothing of it ſelfe in it, is no obedience; And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes except it hath ſomething of it ſelfe, it is leſſe. For example, when plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things of this world are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when the higher and more worthy place is commanded to be taken; he, who obeyeth theſe Commands, euacuateth and frustrateth in himſelfe the vertue of Obedience, if out of a ſecret deſire he affecteth them. For he ſuffereth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be gouerned by Obedience, who in vndertaking the proſperous things of his life, ſerueth his owne humour of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</hi> Againe, <hi>When aduerſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staſtfull matters are commanded, when it is commanded to receaue obloquies, and contumelies; except the mind of it ſelfe doth deſire theſe things, the merit of obedience is leſſened; becauſe he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnwillingly to ſuch things, as are
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14178:162"/> abiect and vile in this life. For Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſuffereth detriment, when no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of any part do accompany the mind, prepared to receaue diſgraces or contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies. Therefore Obedience touching things aduerſe and diſpleaſant, ought to haue ſomething of it ſelfe; and againe touching things proſperous and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it ought to haue nothing of it ſelfe. And Obedience, when the ſubiect of it, is a thing diſpleaſing, is ſo much the more glorious and worthy, by how much the deſire of him that obeyeth is more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conioyned to the diuine will; As on the contrary, where the ſubiect is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſweet, Obedience is ſo much the more true by how much the mind is eſtranged from all vayne and humane complacency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the weight of this Vertue of Obedience, we may more clearely bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, if we call to mind the memorable Acts of two men, now reigning in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Moyſes, <hi>when he fed ſheep in the deſert, was called by our Lord ſpeaking to him, by the ministery of an Angell in the fiery Bush, that he ſhould gouerne ouer all the multitude of the Iſraelits. Exod.</hi> 3. <hi>But becauſe he was humble and
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14178:162"/> lowly in himſelfe, he was afraid of the profered glory of ſo great a gouerment; ſaying: I beſeech thee,</hi> O <hi>Lord</hi> I <hi>am not eloquent from yeſterday, and the day before, and ſince thou haſt ſpoken to thy ſeruant, I haue more impediment and ſlownes of tongue &amp;c. I beſeech thee, O Lord, ſend whom thou wilt ſend. Behould heere, how Moyſes diſcourſeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth with the Authour of the Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue; and acknowledged himſelfe to be of imperfect ſpeach, that thereby he might auoyde the power of ſo great a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and gouernment. In like ſort, S. Paul was admoniſhed from Heauen (as himſelfe teſtifieth in his</hi> 2. <hi>Epistle to the</hi> Galathians) <hi>that he ought to aſcend to Ieruſalem; Who meeting with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Agabus <hi>in his iourney, was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, how great aduerſity and trouble did expect and wayte for him in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. For it is thus written:</hi> Agabus <hi>tooke Paules girdle, &amp; binding his owne hands and feete, he ſaid: Thus the man whoſe girdle this is, ſo ſhall the Iewes bind in Ieruſalem, Act.</hi> 22. But <hi>S. Paul inſtantly anſwered:</hi> I <hi>am ready not only to be bound, but to dye alſo in Ieruſalem, for the name of Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:14178:163"/>
               <p>Thus <hi>S. Paul through a command of diuine Reuelation going towards Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, knoweth afore hand, what vexations were there to afflict him; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles he willingly deſireth them: He heareth of troubles, of which he might well be afraid; yet he coueteth with all endeauour oo aſpire to them. Thus Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hath no part of his owne deſire tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his command; and therefore he partly laboureth againſt the coommand, thereby to eſchew his gouernment ouer the Iſraelites. But S. Paul is drawne to vndergoe aduerſities out of his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; who foreſeeing imminent euills, boyleth in deuotion of ſpirit to ſustaine farre greater. The former man was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to decline the glory of preſent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, though God commanded him to accept thereof: This later (God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for him aſperity and molestations) thirſteth after more violent afflictions, yea euen death it ſelfe. Now from the immoueable Vertue of theſe two worthy Captaines leading vs the way, we may be instructed, that if we deſire earnestly to gaine the palme and reward of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we must play the ſouldiers, in performing things proſperous only by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14178:163"/> though with ſome reluctation of our owne Nature; but things aduerſe &amp; distaſtfull, to execute euen out of our owne deuotion and Zeale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre <hi>S. Gregory</hi> Which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Chriſt our Lord &amp; Maiſter, euen from his owne example moſt cleerly approued. For when he knew the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude would come and take him, that they might make him a King, we read; <hi>That he fled into the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, himſelfe alone.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw that the Iewes &amp; the ſouldiers with <hi>Iudas,</hi> were to come to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him, &amp; draw him to puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which he receaued from his Father, he of his owne accord did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently meete them, and ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be taken and bound. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt not in words did vaunt of Obedience; but in workes, and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, exhibited Obedience vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, grounded in true Patience and Humility. Vpon this example of the moſt noble vertue of Obedience, all thoſe ought to haue their eyes fixed, who aſpire to the high reward, due for a voluntary abnegation of ones <hi>proper Will,</hi> and <hi>imitation of Christ.</hi>
